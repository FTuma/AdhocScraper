Group EBIT sums up to EUR minus 1.6 billion (Q2 2018: EUR 2.6 billion). EBIT for the divisions amounts to: - Mercedes-Benz Cars: EUR minus 0.7 billion (Q2 2018: EUR 1.9 billion) - Daimler Trucks: EUR 0.7 billion (Q2 2018: EUR 0.5 billion) - Mercedes-Benz Vans: EUR minus 2.0 billion (Q2 2018: EUR 0.2 billion) - Daimler Buses: EUR 0.1 billion (Q2 2018: EUR 0.1 billion) - Daimler Financial Services: EUR 0.4 billion (Q2 2018: EUR 0.1 billion) - Reconciliation: EUR minus 0.1 billion (Q2 2018: EUR minus 0.1 billion) All mentioned figures are preliminary and unaudited. In addition to the facts already disclosed in our ad-hoc notification dated June 23, 2019, the following major items had an impact on EBIT: - New information lead to a revised risk assessment with regard to provisions for an extended recall in Europe and Rest of World in connection with Takata airbags. Provisions had to be increased by around EUR 1.0 billion. - In addition, EBIT was impacted by a reassessment made today in connection with ongoing governmental and court proceedings and measures relating to Mercedes-Benz Diesel vehicles in various regions, which lead to an increase in expected expenses by around EUR 1.6 billion. - Finally, a decision by the Board of Management in the context of the product portfolio review and prioritization, which was taken today, will affect earnings of the Mercedes-Benz Vans division in the second quarter 2019 by around EUR 0.5 billion. When reassessing the earnings outlook for 2019, in addition to the factors mentioned above, also adjusted sales and earnings projections resulting from the following factors had to be taken into account: - Slower product ramp ups affecting product availability throughout 2019 and - lower growth in automotive markets than expected. As a result, Daimler now has the following outlook for Group EBIT and for the Return on Sales (RoS) of the divisions: - Outlook for Group EBIT now expected to be significantly below prior year level (previously in the same magnitude) - Mercedes-Benz Cars now expected to be 3 % to 5 % RoS (previously 6 % to 8 %) - Daimler Trucks unchanged 7 % to 9 % RoS - Mercedes-Benz Vans now expected to be minus 15 % to minus 17 % RoS (previously minus 2 % to minus 4 %) - Daimler Buses unchanged 5 % to 7 % RoS - Daimler Financial Services unchanged 17 % to 19 % Return on Equity The free cash flow of the industrial business for the second quarter 2019 is expected to be below the respective previous year quarter. For the financial year 2019 the free cashflow of the industrial business can no longer be expected to be slightly higher than 2018. EBIT and Return on Sales are defined as on p. 344/345 of the Daimler Annual Report 2018.

120,BASF SE,Deutschland,BASF SE: BASF Group: EBIT before special items in Q2 2019 considerably below expectations; outlook for full year 2019 lowered ,DE000BASF111,1169331,"BASF Group: EBIT before special items in Q2 2019 considerably below expectations; outlook for full year 2019 lowered - EBIT before special items expected to be EUR1.0 billion (down 47% compared with the second quarter of 2018) - Significantly weaker-than-expected industrial production weighs on volumes and margin development at BASF; weak development of the agricultural sector in North America an additional burden - EBIT expected to be EUR0.5 billion (down 71% compared with the second quarter of 2018) - Net income expected to be EUR6.5 billion due to the deconsolidation of Wintershall (up EUR5.0 billion compared with the second quarter of 2018) - Outlook 2019: EBIT before special items now expected to be up to 30% below prior-year level Ludwigshafen - July 8, 2019 - Significantly weaker-than-expected industrial production negatively impacted volumes and margin development at BASF. At around 1.5% according to current estimates, growth in industrial production in the first half of 2019 was much slower than expected. The downturn in growth in the global automotive industry was particularly strong: Globally, production declined by around 6% in the first half of 2019. In China, the world's largest automotive market, the decrease was more than twice as high, at around 13%. The weak development of the agricultural sector in North America was an additional burden: Due to difficult weather conditions, the planting of key field crops in the region was down from the previous year and far below the historical average. The decrease in earnings prospects for farmers and the trade disputes led to lower demand for crop protection products. To date, the conflicts between the United States and its trading partners, particularly China, have not eased - contrary to what was assumed in the BASF Report 2018. In fact, the G20 summit at the end of June has shown that a rapid détente is not to be expected in the second half of 2019. Overall, uncertainty remains high. In this environment, the preliminary figures for the second quarter of 2019 are significantly below current analyst estimates and BASF's expectations at the beginning of the year. Sales declined by 4% in the second quarter of 2019 to EUR15.2 billion (second quarter of 2018: EUR15.8 billion). EBIT before special items for the second quarter of 2019 is expected to be EUR1.0 billion, 47% below the figure for the same quarter of the previous year (second quarter of 2018: EUR2.0 billion). The decline in EBIT before special items was mainly the result of considerably lower earnings in the Materials, Chemicals and Agricultural Solutions segments compared with the prior-year quarter. As expected, significantly lower isocyanates prices led to a considerable year-on-year decline in the Materials segment's EBIT before special items in the second quarter of 2019. In the Chemicals segment, the decrease was primarily due to the scheduled turnarounds of the steam crackers in Port Arthur, Texas, and Antwerp, Belgium; furthermore, margins for steam cracker products, especially in North America, were considerably lower than BASF forecast. EBIT before special items in the Agricultural Solutions segment was negatively impacted by the weak development of the agricultural sector in North America as a result of unpredictably difficult weather conditions and the trade conflict between the United States and China. In this challenging global economic environment, EBIT before special items in the remaining segments was either considerably (Industrial Solutions) or slightly (Surface Technologies; Nutrition & Care) higher year on year. EBIT before special items attributable to Other declined considerably compared with the prior-year quarter. The BASF Group's EBIT for the second quarter of 2019 is expected to be 71% lower year on year, at EUR0.5 billion (second quarter of 2018: EUR1.9 billion). In addition to the decrease in EBIT before special items, this is mainly due to one-time costs for the excellence program and the impairment of a natural gas-based investment on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which BASF is no longer pursuing. BASF is systematically implementing the measures announced in connection with its strategy, especially regarding portfolio management and cost reduction. The ongoing excellence program is expected to deliver a positive contribution to EBITDA of EUR2 billion annually from the end of 2021 onward. In total, BASF is planning a reduction of around 6,000 positions worldwide by the end of 2021. Net income is expected to increase to EUR6.5 billion (second quarter of 2018: EUR1.5 billion). This is due to the book gain from the deconsolidation of Wintershall with the closing of the merger of Wintershall and DEA on May 1, 2019. It will be shown in income after taxes from discontinued operations. Outlook for the full year 2019 lowered As a consequence of the considerably weaker-than-expected business development in the second quarter of 2019 and the slowdown in global economic growth and industrial production, mainly due to the trade conflicts, BASF now anticipates considerably lower EBIT before special items of up to 30% below the prior-year level (previous forecast: slight increase in EBIT before special items of 1-10%). For sales, BASF now expects a slight decline compared with the full year 2018 (previous forecast: slight sales growth of 1-5%). Return on capital employed (ROCE) for the full year 2019 is now expected to decline considerably compared with the previous year (previous forecast: ROCE slightly, i.e. 0.1-1.0 precentage points, lower than in 2018).

On Thursday, July 25, 2019 at 07:00 a.m. CEST, BASF will publish its Half-Year Financial Report for the first half of 2019 and will comment on the figures at the telephone conferences for journalists (from 09:00 a.m. CEST) and analysts and investors (from 11:00 a.m. CEST).

To date, no final decision has been taken in this regard. Following a potential separation, Leoni's primary focus would be on the development of its Wiring Systems Division (WSD). To this end, Leoni has begun to mandate respective advisors. Leoni will inform shareholders and the public as soon as relevant developments arise. The decision to prepare a separation of its WCS division followed a further review of the existing group structure and strategy for each division in the context of the previously announced VALUE 21 programme. This also included a review of the optimal future ownership structure of WCS and WSD to determine how both divisions can achieve their full potential. As communicated, Leoni's Board of Directors sees only very limited synergies between both divisions and intends to increase their operational independence. In this context, corporate support functions will transfer from the holding company to the divisions. WCS increasingly focuses on advanced and intelligent cable solutions and services and WSD further enhances its energy and data solutions and services related capabilities. The implementation of the VALUE 21 programme is progressing according to plan to achieve sustainable gross cost savings targets of EUR 500 million per year by 2022 for the existing group (with a targeted EBIT margin impact of +2-3%-pts and a targeted FCF yield impact of +4-5%-pts). Around 75% of the savings are expected to be realized in WSD.

The company has taken on Funkwerk AG (""Funkwerk"") as an anchor and backstop investor for the capital increase. Funkwerk is a leading provider of innovative communication, information and security systems and intends to acquire up to around 28% of euromicron AG's share capital after the capital measures have been implemented. The next Annual General Meeting of euromicron AG will take place on Thursday, August 29, 2019. In this context, Funkwerk is expected to propose at least one candidate for the Supervisory Board seats to be elected, subject to approval of the share purchase by the antitrust authorities. The new shares are to be issued in the form of cash capital increases in two tranches. With the first tranche, 717,639 new shares were issued to Funkwerk as part of a private placement excluding shareholders' subscription rights. This will increase the company's share capital to EUR 20,182,308.60, i.e. by 10 %. The new shares are entitled to dividends from January 1, 2019. The placement price was set at EUR 3.40 per share, so that the gross issue proceeds for the first tranche amount to EUR 2,439,972.60. The second tranche is to be effected without a prospectus as part of a cash capital increase with subscription rights. Subject to the registration of the implementation of the first tranche, the share capital of the company will be increased by a further amount of up to EUR 5,504,266.28 by issuing up to 2,152,919 new registered shares. The subscription period is scheduled to begin at the end of July 2019. Further details can be found in the subscription offer, which is expected to be published in the Federal Gazette on July 25, 2019. Funkwerk has committed itself to the company to take over all shares not subscribed to by existing euromicron shareholders (so-called backstop obligation). Funkwerk AG's backstop obligation is subject to approval by the antitrust authorities in the Federal Republic of Germany and Austria. The subscription price was set at EUR 3.40 per share, so that the gross issue proceeds for the second tranche amount to up to EUR 7,319,924.60. The shares from the second tranche will be admitted to the stock exchange and included in stock exchange trading later, probably in July 2020. The total gross proceeds from the two capital increases of up to EUR 9.759.897,20 are to be used to accelerate the implementation of euromicron AG's strategic development, such as the digitalization of service processes and the further development of digital business models for our customers, as well as general company financing. The cooperation and the anchor investment are intended to open up joint potential for both companies in the area of critical infrastructures and synergies in the areas of Smart Building Solutions and IoT solutions.

243,Krones AG,Deutschland,Krones AG: Krones adjusts its earnings outlook for 2019 ,DE0006335003,1170389,"Ad-hoc disclosure 10. July 2019 Krones adjusts its earnings outlook for 2019 Based on the actual available figures Krones, the world's leading manufacturer of filling and packaging technology, adjusts its earnings outlook for the fiscal year 2019. While the revenue growth of Krones in the first six month of 2019 were still satisfactory, the earnings before tax (EBT) for this period will be significantly below the expectations of Krones. The profitability of Krones is influenced by high costs, in particular the material cost ratio, remains on high level. Krones expected that the weaker economic outlook in other important industries in 2019 would have resulted in an easing in the increasing of material costs. Also, the additional measures, which are implemented by Krones to reduce the material costs materialize with a delay. Furthermore, the product mix has an unfavorable effect on the earnings for the period January till June 2019. Especially in the second quarter 2019 the sales of products with a high own value added, like machines and lines for the plastic technology, were lower than expected. Another important reason for the actual earnings development is the sales growth of the high-margin after sales business (LCS), which were in the first 6 month of 2019 below expectations. The demand of the customers of Krones for some parts of the LCS product and service offering, were negatively influenced by the macroeconomic uncertainties. In the second half year the LCS business is expected to recover. Krones still expects an unchanged growth target of 3% in 2019. The EBT margin is planned around 3% (prior target: around 6%). For its third target, working capital to revenue, Krones expects an unchanged figure of 26%. The board has taken measures in order to counteract the earnings decline. This includes among others a hiring freeze and measures to reduce the material costs. The strategic measures that Krones has introduced so far, like the price increase and the development of the global footprint are however not sufficient to reach the ambitious targets. Hence, the board is working in additional structural changes in order to strengthen its earning level in the long run. Krones keeps its mid term targets. Depending on the macro economic environment and development of Krones markets, the board envisages a year-on-year revenue growth of 3 to 5% without acquisition effects, an EBT margin of 6 to 8% and a working capital to revenue ratio of 22 to 24%. Krones will publish the interim report as of June 30th of 2019 by 25th of July 2019. Explanation of financial key figures of Krones: The EBT margin is the earnings before taxes in relation to sales. The key figures Working Capital to Revenue is calculated as the average of Working Capital to revenue of the last four quarters.

Repeated postponements of orders with significant volumes led to a disappointing order intake of around EUR 85 million in the first half of the year. Against this backdrop, revenues of EUR 240 to 260 million are now expected for the current fiscal year. Adjusted EBIT is forecast at up to EUR 22 million, but may be reduced to EUR 16 million depending on further market developments. The main reasons for this development are the decline in vehicle sales and the resulting uncertainty in the automotive industry, which is reflected in a considerable reluctance to invest and cost discipline by manufacturers and suppliers. Aumann expects these factors to continue beyond the current fiscal year, but considers the medium-term trend in e-mobility to be unbroken.

In spite of the currently difficult market conditions the long-term market trends, the technology and the product pipeline remain strong. Sensirion consequently confirms its mid- and long-term growth perspectives. Reduced outlook for financial year 2019, gross margin stable Sensirion adjusts its outlook for financial year 2019 as a result of the challenging market conditions. Under the updated outlook, we expect for financial year 2019 revenue of CHF 160-170 million (previously CHF 175-190 million), adjusted EBITDA margin of 9-12% (previously 15-16%) and unchanged strong gross margin of 52-54%. The current crisis in the automotive industry, the significantly weaker than expected global industrial production as well as the continuing global trade disputes negatively impact demand in all end markets. In contrast to the assessment at the beginning of the year, we do not see any signals from our customers pointing to the originally expected recovery in the second half of 2019. Furthermore, the start of production of an important customer project was postponed by the customer by a few months into the first half of 2020, which additionally impacts revenue in 2019. EBITDA margin suffers disproportionately under reduced revenue because of the low variable costs of our products. Newly won business cannot yet fully compensate for this demand reduction because typically two to three years pass from project win to start of mass production. Half-year revenue at approximately CHF 83.5 million For the first half of 2019, revenue amounts to approx. CHF 83.5 million (c. -7% year-over-year and -1% compared to the previous period). Further details on the half-year results will follow with their publication on 21 August 2019. Strategy and mid-term growth perspectives confirmed In spite of the currently difficult market conditions the long-term market trends, the technology and the product pipeline remain strong. Sensirion consequently confirms its mid- and long-term growth perspectives: In the automotive market, we could achieve important design-wins for modules in the past months, which will contribute to revenue in approximately three years from now. In the industrial market, we see an increasing demand for higher-value combo-modules, which make possible measuring several environmental parameters with one unit. Both of these expansions of our product portfolio enable us to increase the content in important customer applications. As a result of existing customer projects and these positive mid- and long-term growth opportunities we maintain our current R&D-intensity and the ongoing expansion of our production site in China.

494,Deutsche Beteiligungs AG,Germany,Deutsche Beteiligungs AG: Third-quarter consolidated net income down considerably year-on-year - lower guidance for the 2018/2019 financial year ,DE000A1TNUT7,1170405,"Deutsche Beteiligungs AG (""DBAG"") expects to post consolidated net income for the third quarter of the 2018/2019 financial year (1 October 2018 to 30 September 2019) that will be considerably lower than the result for the same quarter of the previous financial year, due to significantly lower net gains or losses from investment activity. DBAG determines the fair value of its investments, in accordance with IFRS, as at each quarterly reporting date. At present, the Company is in the process of determining the measurement of the individual portfolio companies as at 30 June 2019, using earnings multiples derived from capital market valuations as well as information on the economic development of these portfolio companies. Changes in the measurement of all portfolio companies, compared to the preceding reporting date, usually have a significant impact upon net gains and losses from investment activity - and hence, on DBAG's consolidated net income. In the third quarter of the 2017/2018 financial year, DBAG generated (adjusted) consolidated net income of 9.1 million euros, based on (adjusted) net gains and losses from investment activity of 8.4 million euros. It is becoming apparent that the relevant figure for the current reporting period - the third quarter of 2018/2019 (1 April to 30 June 2019) - will be lower by as much as 50 per cent. Hence, consolidated net income for the third quarter of 2018/2019 will be significantly lower than the figure for the same quarter of the previous financial year. Accordingly, we withdraw our guidance for the 2018/2019 financial year. To date, we had anticipated a moderate decline for 2018/2019 consolidated net income - that is, a decline of between 20 per cent and 40 per cent, compared to the reference point of our guidance (48.0 million euros). We now expect consolidated net income to be significantly - i.e. more than 40 per cent - lower. Based on current knowledge, we expect consolidated net income to be positive, however. Given that capital market developments cannot be planned, DBAG generally does not include contributions from changes in earnings multiples derived from capital market valuations in its forecasts. Adjusted guidance for the 2018/2019 financial year is thus also subject to the proviso that valuation levels on the capital markets as at 30 September 2019 will not have changed materially from the current reporting date. DBAG is currently preparing its interim consolidated financial statements as at 30 June 2019, which will be published on 8 August 2019.

125,Deutsche Bank AG,Deutschland,Deutsche Bank outlines significant strategic transformation and restructuring plans ,DE0005140008,1168829,"Deutsche Bank outlines significant strategic transformation and restructuring plans Frankfurt am Main, 7 July 2019 - As part of its ongoing commitment to improve long-term profitability and returns to shareholders, Deutsche Bank's Management Board announces a series of measures to restructure the bank's operations. These measures include: The exit of Global Equities and a significant reduction in Corporate and Investment Banking risk weighted assets Deutsche Bank will exit its Equities Sales & Trading business, while retaining a focused equity capital markets operation. In addition, the bank plans to resize its Fixed Income operations in particular its Rates business and will accelerate the wind-down of its existing non-strategic portfolio. In aggregate, Deutsche Bank will reduce risk-weighted assets currently allocated to these businesses by approximately 40%. The bank will create a new Capital Release Unit to manage the efficient wind-down of the assets related to business activities, which are being exited or reduced. These assets and businesses represented EUR 74 billion of risk-weighted assets and EUR 288 billion of leverage exposure, as of 31 December 2018. These actions are designed to allow Deutsche Bank to focus on and invest in its core, market leading businesses of Corporate Banking, Financing, Foreign Exchange, Origination & Advisory, Private Banking, and Asset Management. A significant restructuring of businesses and infrastructure Deutsche Bank will implement a cost reduction program designed to reduce adjusted costs to EUR 17 billion in 2022 and is targeting a cost income ratio of 70% in that year. To facilitate its restructuring, Deutsche Bank expects to take approximately EUR 3 billion of aggregate charges in the second quarter of 2019, of which approximately EUR 0.2 billion would impact Common Equity Tier 1 capital. These charges include a Deferred Tax Asset write-down of approximately EUR 2 billion and impairments of approximately EUR 0.9 billion. Additional restructuring charges are expected in the second half of 2019 and subsequent years. In aggregate, Deutsche Bank currently expects cumulative charges of EUR 7.4 billion by the end of 2022. Managing the transformation through existing resources Deutsche Bank management intends to fund its transformation from its existing resources without requiring additional capital. This reflects the bank's current strong capital position as well as management's confidence in the high quality and low risk nature of the assets, which it is exiting. In connection with these decisions, the Management Board intends to recommend no common equity dividend be paid for the financial years 2019 and 2020. The bank expects to have capacity for payments on additional tier 1 securities throughout the transformation phase. Updated capital and leverage targets The Management Board believes that the future business mix is consistent with a lower capital requirement. After consultation with the bank's regulators, the bank now intends to operate with a minimum CET1 ratio of 12.5% going forward. As a result of the significant deleveraging actions, the bank targets a fully-loaded leverage ratio of 4.5% by the end of 2020 rising to approximately 5% by 2022. Preliminary Second Quarter Results Including the charges related to the restructuring described above, Deutsche Bank expects to report a second quarter 2019 loss before income taxes of approximately EUR 500 million and a net loss of EUR 2.8 billion. Excluding these charges, Deutsche Bank expects to report second quarter 2019 income before income taxes of approximately EUR 400 million and net profit of EUR 120 million. Results reflect revenues of EUR 6.2 billion with noninterest expenses of EUR 5.6 billion and adjusted costs of EUR 5.35 billion. The bank intends to release second quarter results on 24 July 2019.

Based on preliminary numbers for the 2018/2019 financial year, Bastei Lübbe AG (ISIN DE000A1X3YY0) has exceeded its forecast, last updated in February 2019, for the three key figures revenues, earnings and debt. Accordingly, consolidated revenues of around EUR 95 million were achieved in fiscal year 2018/2019. In its forecast, the Executive Board of Bastei Lübbe AG had expected revenues of Euro 90 million. The overachievement is due to an improved business situation in the Book and Games segments. Consolidated earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) came out between EUR 2 million and EUR 2.5 million according to preliminary numbers, and thus at least at the upper end of the forecast range of EUR 0.5 million to EUR 2 million. In the previous year, which was burdened by restructuring measures, a negative EBIT of EUR -18.0 million was achieved. The better-than-expected development in the 2018/2019 financial year is mainly due to higher Group revenues and lower restructuring costs. Net debt as of March 31, 2019 was around EUR 18 million instead of the forecast EUR 25 million, and thus also better than expected. Compared to the previous year (EUR 30.1 million), it was reduced by 40%. This is mainly due to the positive development in the fourth quarter of the financial year and cautious liquidity planning. The final audited annual financials will be published as planned on 11 July 2019 with the 2018/2019 annual report of Bastei Lübbe AG.

9622,Orascom Development Holding AG,Schweiz,"Orascom Development Holding AG: Germany Removes Travel Ban Restrictions on Taba, Egypt. Directly Benefiting Orascom's Taba Heights Destination ",CH0038285679,1166519,"Press Release Germany Removes Travel Ban Restrictions on Taba, Egypt Directly Benefiting Orascom's Taba Heights Destination Altdorf, July 1, 2019 - Building on the enhanced structural reforms adapted by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and the strong recovery signals of Egypt's tourism, Orascom Development Holding (ODH) is pleased to announce that the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs has removed its travel ban restrictions from Germany to Taba International Airport. This decision will push more flights to Taba Heights, Orascom's second largest hotel destination and the largest touristic destination in the South Sinai region. According to an official statement given by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs (https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en), restrictions on all German airlines - imposed in October 2015 - to travel to Taba have been removed. The decision means that all airlines are allowed again to fly directly to Taba International Airport, echoing the now stable security conditions in the region and will hopefully encourage further countries to follow suit. Taba Heights is a fully self-sufficient resort town, located in Taba, South of Sinai. The town offers six hotels (five 5 stars and one 4 stars) with 2,365 guest rooms and a wide range of international-standard facilities including an international marina port. CEO Khaled Bichara said: ""Very positive news for us as a group that would now position our second largest hotel destination, Taba Heights, on the right track to growth and profitability. Although Taba Heights has almost the same number of rooms as El Gouna, yet El Gouna hotel's revenues were ten times those of Taba's in FY 2018, because of the travel restrictions that were imposed by the European countries and the ongoing bans by Russia. Now with the lifting of the restrictions, the potential upside for the destination can be achievable, noting that in 2010, Taba Heights used to generate approximately USD 20 million of pure EBITDA."" About Orascom Development Holding (ODH): Orascom Development Holding (ODH) is a leading developer of fully integrated destinations that include hotels, private villas and apartments, leisure facilities such as golf courses, marinas and supporting infrastructure. Orascom Development's diversified portfolio of destinations is spread over seven jurisdictions (Egypt, UAE, Oman, Switzerland, Morocco, Montenegro and United Kingdom), with primary focus on touristic destinations. The Group currently operates nine destinations; four in Egypt (El Gouna, Taba Heights, Fayoum and Makadi Heights), The Cove in the United Arab Emirates, Jebel Sifah and Hawana Salalah in Oman, Luštica Bay in Montenegro and Andermatt in Switzerland.

(""GFG"") places a total of 44,000,000 shares, consisting of 40,000,000 new shares from a capital increase against cash contributions and 4,000,000 existing shares to cover over-allotments. The existing shares were made available by way of a share loan. In case no stabilization measures are undertaken, and the underwriters therefore exercise the option granted to them to acquire a number of shares corresponding to the over-allotment (greenshoe option), GFG will issue additional new shares and receive the proceeds from the over-allotment (primary greenshoe). The placement price per share was set at EUR4.50 per share. Total gross proceeds amount to EUR180 million if the greenshoe option is not exercised and EUR198 million if the greenshoe option is fully exercised. The gross proceeds, net of commissions and expenses, will solely accrue to GFG. Kinnevik Internet Lux S.à r.l. and Rocket Internet SE will be allocated shares for EUR60 million and approximately EUR50 million, respectively. GFG's shares are expected to start trading on the regulated market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the trading symbol GFG, the securities identification number (WKN) A2PLUG and the international securities identification number (ISIN) LU2010095458 on 2 July 2019, with settlement of the offering planned for 4 July 2019. --Ends-- Media contact: Jovana Lakcevic Head of PR & Communications, GFG jovana.lakcevic@global-fashion-group.com +447990 038510 Investor Relations: investorrelations@global-fashion-group.com Disclaimer This release is not for distribution, directly or indirectly, in or into the United States (including its territories and possessions, any State of the United States and the District of Columbia), Australia, Canada or Japan.

They will not regard any other person as their respective clients in relation to the Offering and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Company for providing the protections afforded to their respective clients, nor for providing advice in relation to the Offering, the contents of this announcement or any transaction, arrangement or other matter referred to herein. In connection with the Offering, the Joint Bookrunners and any of their affiliates, may take up a portion of the shares offered in the Offering as a principal position and in that capacity may retain, purchase, sell, offer to sell for their own accounts such shares and other securities of the Company or related investments in connection with the Offering or otherwise.

In connection with the placement of the shares in the Company, Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, acting for the account of the underwriters, will act as stabilization manager (the ""Stabilization Manager"") and may, as Stabilization Manager, make overallotments and take stabilization measures in accordance with legal requirements (Article 5 para. 4 and 5 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 in conjunction with Articles 5 through 8 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052). Stabilization measures aim at supporting the market price of the Company's shares during the stabilization period, such period starting on the date the Company's shares commence trading on the regulated market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse), expected to be July 2, 2019, and ending no later than 30 calendar days thereafter (the ""Stabilization Period""). However, the Stabilization Manager is under no obligation to take any stabilization measures. Therefore, stabilization measures may not necessarily occur and may cease at any time. These measures may result in the market price of the Company's shares being higher than would otherwise have been the case. Moreover, the market price may temporarily be at an unsustainable level. In connection with such stabilization measures, investors may, in addition to the newly issued shares, be allocated up to 4,000,000 over-allotment shares (such number not to exceed 15% of the final number of newly issued shares placed in the Offering). In addition, the Company has granted the underwriters an option to acquire a number of shares in the Company equal to the number of over-allotment shares at the final offer price, less agreed commissions (so-called Greenshoe option). To the extent over-allotment shares are allocated to investors in the Offering, the Stabilization Manager, acting for the account of the underwriters, is entitled to exercise this Greenshoe option if such exercise follows a sale of shares by the Stabilization Manager which the Stabilization Manager had previously acquired as part of stabilization measures (so-called refreshing the shoe). Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements contained within: (a) EU Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended (""MiFID II""); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 supplementing MiFID II; and (c) local implementing measures (together, the ""MiFID II Product Governance Requirements""), and disclaiming all and any liability, whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise, which any ""manufacturer"" (for the purposes of the MiFID II Product Governance Requirements) may otherwise have with respect thereto, the shares have been subject to a product approval process, which has determined that such shares are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution channels as are permitted by MiFID II (the ""Target Market Assessment""). Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Offering. For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the shares. Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.

Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Offering. For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the shares. Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.",2019-06-29 01:00:00,https://dgap.de/dgap/News/adhoc/global-fashion-group-places-shares-eur-per-share/?companyID=394161&newsID=1165891,A2PLUG

KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft has issued an unqualified audit certificate for the financial statements. Delticom AG achieved EBITDA of EUR 9.0 million in the past fiscal year according to audited IFRS group figures, a decrease of 3.3 % compared to the previous year's figure of EUR 9.3 million. EBITDA for fiscal year 2018 is thus EUR 3.0 million lower than the preliminary figure announced in March. The valuation of All you need GmbH, which was acquired by Delticom last year, resulted in an adjustment requirement of EUR 2.5 million affecting net income. While earnings before taxes were positive at EUR 426 thousand (2017: EUR 1.7 million), consolidated net income amounted to EUR -1.7 million (2017: EUR 1.1 million). Earnings per share amounted to EUR -0.13 (diluted and undiluted; 2017: EUR 0.09). The earnings development is based on a significantly higher tax expense of EUR 2.1 million (2017: EUR 0.5 million) compared to the previous year, which resulted primarily from deferred tax expenses (totaling EUR 1.5 million), in particular in connection with loss carryforwards. Against the backdrop of last year's earnings performance and in view of the investments required in the current year to create the structures necessary to return to a sustainably profitable growth course, the Management Board has decided to propose to the Annual General Meeting to not pay any dividend for the past financial year (2017: EUR 0.10 per share). This step goes hand in hand with the objective of strengthening Delticom AG's earnings power in order to enable shareholders to participate in Delticom's business success again in the future. The Annual General Meeting will be held in Hanover on 12 August 2019. Delticom will publish its 2018 financial statement on 26 June 2019 on its website www.delti.com in the Investor Relations section.

MEDIA RELEASE Lalique Group announces agreement with DS Group for purchase of shares as well as timetable and parameters of planned rights issue Zurich, 25 June 2019 - Lalique Group (SIX: LLQ) and its Chairman Silvio Denz have reached an agreement with Dharampal Satyapal (DS) Group, a diversified conglomerate headquartered in India, under which DS Group will purchase shares from Silvio Denz and through the upcoming rights issue, resulting in a stake in Lalique Group of around 11% to 18%. The offering and listing prospectus for the rights issue for a total of up to 1,200,000 new shares is expected to be published on 1 July 2019, and the subscription period is planned to begin on 3 July 2019. Silvio Denz will remain the majority shareholder of Lalique Group after completion of the rights issue and the agreement with DS Group. As part of the rights issue, Lalique Group's current share capital of CHF 1,200,000, divided into 6,000,000 shares with a par value of CHF 0.20 each, is to be increased by up to 1,200,000 new shares, representing a total nominal amount of up to CHF 240,000. The new shares will be issued from the existing authorized capital approved at the Ordinary General Meeting on 24 May 2019. Existing shareholders will be granted subscription rights entitling them to purchase one new Lalique Group share at a subscription price of CHF 40 for every 5 shares held on 2 July 2019 after close of trading at the SIX Swiss Exchange. To increase the current free float of around 28% and broaden the investor base, Silvio Denz will not exercise his subscription rights. The subscription period is expected to run from 3 until 9 July 2019. Subsequent to the subscription period, shares for which the subscription rights are not exercised will be placed in the market by Lalique Group. The listing and first day of trading of the new shares on the SIX Swiss Exchange are planned for 12 July 2019. Zürcher Kantonalbank is Lead Manager for the capital increase. As previously communicated, the capital increase is related to the acquisition of The Glenturret, Scotland's oldest working single malt whisky distillery, completed on 29 March 2019. The purchase price of GBP 15.5 million, paid in cash, for the 50% stake acquired in The Glenturret by Lalique Group as well as working capital of approx. CHF 4 million were financed through a shareholder loan from Silvio Denz. The proceeds from the capital increase will be used to in part refinance this shareholder loan and to finance further Lalique Group investments and growth initiatives.

MEDIA RELEASE Lalique Group announces agreement with DS Group for purchase of shares as well as timetable and parameters of planned rights issue Zurich, 25 June 2019 - Lalique Group (SIX: LLQ) and its Chairman Silvio Denz have reached an agreement with Dharampal Satyapal (DS) Group, a diversified conglomerate headquartered in India, under which DS Group will purchase shares from Silvio Denz and through the upcoming rights issue, resulting in a stake in Lalique Group of around 11% to 18%. The offering and listing prospectus for the rights issue for a total of up to 1,200,000 new shares is expected to be published on 1 July 2019, and the subscription period is planned to begin on 3 July 2019. Silvio Denz will remain the majority shareholder of Lalique Group after completion of the rights issue and the agreement with DS Group. As part of the rights issue, Lalique Group's current share capital of CHF 1,200,000, divided into 6,000,000 shares with a par value of CHF 0.20 each, is to be increased by up to 1,200,000 new shares, representing a total nominal amount of up to CHF 240,000. The new shares will be issued from the existing authorized capital approved at the Ordinary General Meeting on 24 May 2019. Existing shareholders will be granted subscription rights entitling them to purchase one new Lalique Group share at a subscription price of CHF 40 for every 5 shares held on 2 July 2019 after close of trading at the SIX Swiss Exchange. To increase the current free float of around 28% and broaden the investor base, Silvio Denz will not exercise his subscription rights. The subscription period is expected to run from 3 until 9 July 2019. Subsequent to the subscription period, shares for which the subscription rights are not exercised will be placed in the market by Lalique Group. The listing and first day of trading of the new shares on the SIX Swiss Exchange are planned for 12 July 2019. Zürcher Kantonalbank is Lead Manager for the capital increase. As previously communicated, the capital increase is related to the acquisition of The Glenturret, Scotland's oldest working single malt whisky distillery, completed on 29 March 2019. The purchase price of GBP 15.5 million, paid in cash, for the 50% stake acquired in The Glenturret by Lalique Group as well as working capital of approx. CHF 4 million were financed through a shareholder loan from Silvio Denz. The proceeds from the capital increase will be used to in part refinance this shareholder loan and to finance further Lalique Group investments and growth initiatives.

They will not regard any other person as their respective clients in relation to the Offering and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Company for providing the protections afforded to their respective clients, nor for providing advice in relation to the Offering, the contents of this announcement or any transaction, arrangement or other matter referred to herein. In connection with the Offering, the Joint Bookrunners and any of their affiliates, may take up a portion of the shares offered in the Offering as a principal position and in that capacity may retain, purchase, sell, offer to sell for their own accounts such shares and other securities of the Company or related investments in connection with the Offering or otherwise.

In connection with the placement of the shares in the Company, Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co.

Stabilization measures aim at supporting the market price of the Company's shares during the stabilization period, such period starting on the date the Company's shares commence trading on the regulated market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse), expected to be July 2, 2019, and ending no later than 30 calendar days thereafter (the ""Stabilization Period""). However, the Stabilization Manager is under no obligation to take any stabilization measures. Therefore, stabilization measures may not necessarily occur and may cease at any time. These measures may result in the market price of the Company's shares being higher than would otherwise have been the case. Moreover, the market price may temporarily be at an unsustainable level. In connection with such stabilization measures, investors may, in addition to the newly issued shares, be allocated up to 6,660,000 over-allotment shares (such number not to exceed 15% of the final number of newly issued shares placed in the Offering). In addition, the Company has granted the Joint Bookrunners an option to acquire a number of shares in the Company equal to the number of over-allotment shares at the final offer price, less agreed commissions (so-called Greenshoe option).

Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Offering. For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the shares. Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.

Concurrently, the Management Board has, with the approval of the Supervisory Board of SFC, resolved by way of a determination resolution the subscription price of EUR 10.00 per New Share and the subscription ratio on the basis of the results of the bookbuilding procedure in a private placement for qualified investors. SFC expects gross proceeds from the capital increase in the amount of EUR 27 million. The joint global coordinators, ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft, (Joint Global Coordinators) have agreed, pursuant to a share underwriting agreement with the SFC, dated 25 June 2019, that COMMERZBANK subscribes the New Shares and that the Joint Global Coordinators underwrite the New Shares and offer them to SFC's existing shareholders with a subscription ratio of 4:1. Therefore, the shareholders can acquire one New Share for every four SFC shares they hold. For a fractional amount of 137,597 New Shares, the subscription rights were excluded. Three of SFC's largest shareholders (HPE PRO Institutional Fund B.V., Havensight Capital Ltd. and Conduit Ventures IIA LP, currently holding respectively 26.94%, 7.48% and 7.15%, of SFC's registered share capital) have waived their subscription rights with respect to their entire holdings and to not participate in the subscription offer.

The New Shares subscribed for, and New Shares placed under the private placement to qualified investors subject to claw-back not subscribed for, in connection with the subscription offer are expected to be delivered on 17 July 2019. In the private placement, the Joint Global Coordinators ensured by providing for claw-back rights in the allocation that the New Shares to the extent not relating to waived subscription rights from the three large shareholders and assigned to the joint global coordinators, AMRO Bank N.V. and COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft, are available for subscription by the shareholders of SFC.

Each of the Company and the Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update, review or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this release, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. The Joint Bookrunners, some of which are authorized by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, are acting exclusively for the Company and no-one else in connection with the Offering. They will not regard any other person as their respective clients in relation to the Offering and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Company for providing the protections afforded to their respective clients, nor for providing advice in relation to the Offering, the contents of this announcement or any transaction, arrangement or other matter referred to herein. In connection with the Offering, the Joint Bookrunners and any of their affiliates, may take up a portion of the shares offered in the Offering as a principal position and in that capacity may retain, purchase, sell, offer to sell for their own accounts such shares and other securities of the Company or related investments in connection with the Offering or otherwise. Accordingly, references in the prospectus, once published, to the shares being offered, acquired, placed or otherwise dealt in should be read as including any issue or offer to, or acquisition, placing or dealing by, the Joint Bookrunners and any of their affiliates acting in such capacity. In addition the Joint Bookrunners and any of their affiliates may enter into financing arrangements (including swaps or contracts for differences) with investors in connection with which the Joint Bookrunners and any of their affiliates may from time to time acquire, hold or dispose of shares of the Company. The Joint Bookrunners do not intend to disclose the extent of any such investment or transactions otherwise than in accordance with any legal or regulatory obligations to do so. None of the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective partners, directors, officers, employees, advisers or agents accept any responsibility or liability whatsoever for or makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of the information in this release (or whether any information has been omitted from the release) or any other information relating to the Company, whether written, oral or in a visual or electronic form, and howsoever transmitted or made available, or for any loss howsoever arising from any use of this release or its contents or otherwise arising in connection therewith. In connection with the placement of the shares in the Company, Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, acting for the account of the underwriters, will act as stabilization manager (the ""Stabilization Manager"") and may, as Stabilization Manager, make overallotments and take stabilization measures in accordance with legal requirements (Article 5 para. 4 and 5 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 in conjunction with Articles 5 through 8 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052). Stabilization measures aim at supporting the market price of the Company's shares during the stabilization period, such period starting on the date the Company's shares commence trading on the regulated market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse), expected to be July 2, 2019, and ending no later than 30 calendar days thereafter (the ""Stabilization Period""). However, the Stabilization Manager is under no obligation to take any stabilization measures. Therefore, stabilization measures may not necessarily occur and may cease at any time. These measures may result in the market price of the Company's shares being higher than would otherwise have been the case. Moreover, the market price may temporarily be at an unsustainable level. In connection with such stabilization measures, investors may, in addition to the newly issued shares, be allocated up to 6,435,000 over-allotment shares (such number not to exceed 15% of the final number of newly issued shares placed in the Offering). In addition, the Company has granted the underwriters an option to acquire a number of shares in the Company equal to the number of over-allotment shares at the final offer price, less agreed commissions (so-called Greenshoe option). To the extent over-allotment shares are allocated to investors in the Offering, the Stabilization Manager, acting for the account of the underwriters, is entitled to exercise this Greenshoe option if such exercise follows a sale of shares by the Stabilization Manager which the Stabilization Manager had previously acquired as part of stabilization measures (so-called refreshing the shoe). Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements contained within: (a) EU Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended (""MiFID II""); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 supplementing MiFID II; and (c) local implementing measures (together, the ""MiFID II Product Governance Requirements""), and disclaiming all and any liability, whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise, which any ""manufacturer"" (for the purposes of the MiFID II Product Governance Requirements) may otherwise have with respect thereto, the shares have been subject to a product approval process, which has determined that such shares are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution channels as are permitted by MiFID II (the ""Target Market Assessment""). Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Offering. For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the shares. Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.

Accordingly, references in the prospectus, once published, to the shares being offered, acquired, placed or otherwise dealt in should be read as including any issue or offer to, or acquisition, placing or dealing by, the Joint Bookrunners and any of their affiliates acting in such capacity. In addition the Joint Bookrunners and any of their affiliates may enter into financing arrangements (including swaps or contracts for differences) with investors in connection with which the Joint Bookrunners and any of their affiliates may from time to time acquire, hold or dispose of shares of the Company. The Joint Bookrunners do not intend to disclose the extent of any such investment or transactions otherwise than in accordance with any legal or regulatory obligations to do so. None of the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective partners, directors, officers, employees, advisers or agents accept any responsibility or liability whatsoever for or makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of the information in this release (or whether any information has been omitted from the release) or any other information relating to the Company, whether written, oral or in a visual or electronic form, and howsoever transmitted or made available, or for any loss howsoever arising from any use of this release or its contents or otherwise arising in connection therewith. In connection with the placement of the shares in the Company, Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, acting for the account of the underwriters, will act as stabilization manager (the ""Stabilization Manager"") and may, as Stabilization Manager, make overallotments and take stabilization measures in accordance with legal requirements (Article 5 para. 4 and 5 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 in conjunction with Articles 5 through 8 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052). Stabilization measures aim at supporting the market price of the Company's shares during the stabilization period, such period starting on the date the Company's shares commence trading on the regulated market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse), expected to be July 2, 2019, and ending no later than 30 calendar days thereafter (the ""Stabilization Period""). However, the Stabilization Manager is under no obligation to take any stabilization measures. Therefore, stabilization measures may not necessarily occur and may cease at any time. These measures may result in the market price of the Company's shares being higher than would otherwise have been the case. Moreover, the market price may temporarily be at an unsustainable level. In connection with such stabilization measures, investors may, in addition to the newly issued shares, be allocated up to 6,435,000 over-allotment shares (such number not to exceed 15% of the final number of newly issued shares placed in the Offering). In addition, the Company has granted the underwriters an option to acquire a number of shares in the Company equal to the number of over-allotment shares at the final offer price, less agreed commissions (so-called Greenshoe option). To the extent over-allotment shares are allocated to investors in the Offering, the Stabilization Manager, acting for the account of the underwriters, is entitled to exercise this Greenshoe option if such exercise follows a sale of shares by the Stabilization Manager which the Stabilization Manager had previously acquired as part of stabilization measures (so-called refreshing the shoe). Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements contained within: (a) EU Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended (""MiFID II""); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 supplementing MiFID II; and (c) local implementing measures (together, the ""MiFID II Product Governance Requirements""), and disclaiming all and any liability, whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise, which any ""manufacturer"" (for the purposes of the MiFID II Product Governance Requirements) may otherwise have with respect thereto, the shares have been subject to a product approval process, which has determined that such shares are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution channels as are permitted by MiFID II (the ""Target Market Assessment""). Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Offering. For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the shares. Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.",2019-06-25 16:15:00,https://dgap.de/dgap/News/adhoc/global-fashion-group-global-fashion-group-extends-offer-period/?companyID=394161&newsID=1163995,A2PLUG

Group revenues approaching trend projected in the full-year forecast. Earnings before income tax down by EUR 1.2 million primarily because of prior-year extraordinary income. Full-year forecast confirmed by the Management Board: consolidated earnings expected to improve noticeably although revenues decline at medium single-digit percentage rate. Business in the first six months of the fiscal year 2018/19 was in line with expectations. Group revenues declined by 5.0 percent or EUR 5.5 million from EUR 110.8 million to EUR 105.3 million, thus approaching the trend projected in the full-year forecast. Due to extraordinary income recorded in the same period of the previous year, earnings before income tax dropped by EUR 1.2 million to EUR -1.7 million in the first half of 2018/19, which appears to be quite a strong reduction at first sight. In the previous year, the sale of an unused plot of land in Sri Lanka and of a work of art led to a book profit of EUR 0.8 million. Adjusted for this one-time income, the result before income tax in the first half of the current fiscal year was EUR 0.4 million below, and thus close to the prior year level, as had been expected. Ahlers has concluded its earnings and efficiency increasing programme and is on schedule for the current fiscal year. Operating cash flow stood at EUR 1,5 million at the six-month stage, which was above the previous year's EUR -0.8 million. The Management Board has confirmed the forecast for the fiscal year 2018/19 published in the 2017/18 Annual Report, according to which revenues will decline by a medium single-digit percentage rate. Consolidated earnings after taxes are expected to increase at a high double-digit percentage rate but still to remain negative in 2018/19, which will be a year of transition. In the second half of 2018, provisions for the efficiency programme had reduced the result by around EUR 5 million, whereas this year the company projects hardly any extraordinary expenses but rather one-time income on balance. The company aims to return to profit in 2020 when all measures initiated will take effect. All figures are provisional. The final figures for H1 2018/19 will be published on July 10, 2019.

The all-in-one solution selected by Leclanché is capable of automating the entire battery manufacturing process, from pouch cell stacking and welding to the final assembly of up to 32 different product configurations. In defining the scope and design specifics during the Simultaneous Engineering process, the joint engineering team was able to validate the production process and propose modifications to the battery module design to further increase the efficiency of the proposed manufacturing solution. Furthermore, the use of Comau's LHYTE laser welding machine will enable Leclanché to improve its welding process by granting increased productivity and model flexibility. The project, which was developed using Simultaneous Engineering, features multiple articulated Comau robots and the company's cutting-edge hybrid laser solution, LHYTE, that combines a direct diode and fiber laser source within the same modular system. The line also includes in.Grid, Comau's interactive IoT and MES (Manufacturing Execution System) platform, which will enable data management and complete production, processes and maintenance monitoring, with the option to include remote assistance and teleservice capabilities. Mass and industrial transport is increasingly moving to electric means of propulsion while public authorities enforce regulations. The marine transport alone produces 13% of greenhouse gas emissions and on current projections, emissions are expected to rise by at least 50% by 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario. The collaboration between Comau and Leclanché will drive industrial scale production of energy storage solutions that will help to accelerate the conversion of maritime transport towards more sustainable power solutions. Mauro Fenzi, Comau CEO, pointed out: ""We are proud of being selected by one of the leading companies in the booming battery sector for being part of their strategic growth. This order acquisition confirms that Comau's unique mix of process, digital and robotics competencies is well suited to lead our customers to establish themselves on the E-Mobility market"".

Vorwerk is a civil engineering and plant construction specialist for underground gas, oil and power lines. Friedrich Vorwerk founded the group in 1962 in Tostedt. Vorwerk has over 750 employees operating from nine locations and generated an annual revenue of over EUR 100 million in 2018. The transaction is still subject to the approval of the German antitrust agency. The parties involved in the transaction have agreed not to disclose the purchase price. Vorwerk benefits from the growing need to invest in German gas and electricity grids. The most recent estimates made by the German network agency suggest that more than EUR 6 billion will need to be invested into the German gas network over the next few years. Additionally, the German ""Energiewende"" requires the installation of several thousand kilometres of new power cables to establish a long distance transmission grid. Since large portions of the new power lines are earthbound, the network operators forecast investments exceeding EUR 60 billion by 2030. Vorwerk is one of the few companies within the German market with the necessary know-how and experience in executing such large-scale earthbound power grid construction projects. With MBB's entry, Vorwerk intends to push its growth organically and via acquisitions in the long term. Irene Vorwerk, the widow of the company founder, and Torben Kleinfeldt, the managing partner, will remain shareholders of the company. The management team around Klaus-Dieter Ehlen, Torben Kleinfeldt and Kevin Loots will remain fully in place while MBB is committed to continue the close and successful cooperation with the ""Irene and Friedrich Vorwerk Foundation"". Together with Vorwerk, MBB would have generated a consolidated revenue of over EUR 600 million at an EBITDA margin of more than 10 % with over 3,000 employees in the financial year 2018. MBB still has considerable net liquidity and seeks to grow also through acquisitions going forward.

The new shares were privately placed with selected, qualified and long-term institutional investors at a price of EUR 22.80 per new share and thus at the current market price (without placement discount) using an accelerated book-building procedure. With the successful capital increase, Nanogate has established a major insurance company as an additional anchor investor. In addition, a renowned family office and another international anchor investor participated significantly in the capital increase. As a result of the significantly oversubscribed capital increase, the company will receive gross proceeds amounting to approximately EUR 10.3 million. The new shares shall be entitled to a dividend from the 2018 fiscal year on. A request will be made accordingly to enter the capital increase into the commercial register at Saarbrücken district court; the new shares will be included in trading in the Frankfurt Stock Exchange's Scale segment. With the capital measure, Nanogate SE is taking full advantage of the current authorization of the shareholders' meeting for capital increases from authorized capital against contribution in cash with the exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights. The capital increase was managed by Bankhaus Lampe KG as sole global coordinator and with M.M. Warburg & CO (AG & Co.) KGaA as joint bookrunner as well as A-Xellence AG as advisor.

385310,Polyphor AG,Schweiz,Polyphor announces enrollment of first patient in FORTRESS Phase III clinical trial for balixafortide in combination with eribulin in patients with metastatic breast cancer ,CH0106213793,1161253,"Allschwil, Switzerland, June 19, 2019 Polyphor announces enrollment of first patient in FORTRESS Phase III clinical trial for balixafortide in combination with eribulin in patients with metastatic breast cancer Balixafortide is the most advanced and only CXCR4 antagonist in development in a pivotal Oncology global registration trial. Polyphor today announced the enrollment of the first patient in its FORTRESS clinical trial, the pivotal Phase III study evaluating balixafortide (POL6326) in combination with eribulin for the treatment of patients with HER2 negative, locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Balixafortide is the only CXCR4 antagonist in development for breast cancer and is the most advanced CXCR4 antagonist being developed in solid tumors. ""The enrollment of the first patient in our Phase III clinical study is a significant step forward for the development of balixafortide. There is a significant unmet need for new treatment options for women with metastatic breast cancer who have failed initial standard-of-care chemotherapies. Developing a new treatment option will provide new hope for women with this devastating disease,"" said Giacomo Di Nepi, Chief Executive Officer of Polyphor. ""We are hopeful that the response rates seen in our proof-of-concept study can be replicated in the FORTRESS trial and that balixafortide can make a positive impact on patient outcomes."" FORTRESS (POL6326-009) is an international, multicenter, randomized active-controlled, open-label Phase III trial which will investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of intravenous balixafortide given with eribulin versus eribulin alone in the treatment of HER2 negative, locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The study will comprise a total of 384 patients with HER2 negative MBC, of which 320 patients receiving third or subsequent line and 64 patients receiving second line chemotherapy. Subject to the data Polyphor will have the possibility to submit a filing for accelerated approval approximately six months after the recruitment is completed on the basis of the analysis of the overall response rate (ORR), confirmed by an independent blinded review, and of the associated durability of response. The full approval would be based on the magnitude of Progression Free Survival (PFS) on blinded independent review, supported by an overall survival trend favoring balixafortide arm and a favorable risk-benefit profile.

CXCR4 plays a critical role in tumor growth, survival, angiogenesis and metastasis[i]. High CXCR4 levels have been detected in almost all human tumor types, including breast cancer. High CXCR4 expression is known to correlate with aggressive metastatic behavior of cancer cells and a poor prognosis[ii]. Balixafortide is being developed to improve therapy outcomes in cancer, when used in combination with other agents. Balixafortide is the only CXCR4 antagonist in development for breast cancer and is the most advanced CXCR4 antagonist, being developed in solid tumors, being the first product candidate to reach proof of concept. The molecule was discovered based on Polyphor's proprietary macrocycle technology platform. Balixafortide showed strong results in a Phase Ib/proof of concept clinical trial in combination with eribulin in patients affected with advanced metastatic breast cancer. The development path identified with the input of the FDA is to conduct a single pivotal study to achieve approval in HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients who previously received at least two chemotherapeutic regimens in the metastatic setting. Additionally, there is the possibility of achieving an accelerated approval based on interim results. Polyphor is also conducting preclinical work to establish the potential for balixafortide in combination with other drugs and in other oncology indications. [i] Otsuka S, Bebb G.

STAHL recalls in total 34,500 delivered lamps from the 6036 and 6149 series Waldenburg, 18. June 2019 - The management board of R. STAHL AG resolved today to perform a recall of in total 34,500 lamps from the 6036 and 6149 series produced by R. STAHL Schaltgeräte GmbH, whose casing primarily consists of a polycarbonate tube. Tests have revealed that the long-term stability of the polycarbonate-tubes is not sufficiently provided in unfavourable operating conditions. Lamps affected stem from the production period between December 2017 to March 2019. So far, R. STAHL AG is not aware of any complaints or cases of damages in the market resulting from premature aging of the polycarbonate-tubes. The management board of R. STAHL AG estimates, based on current knowledge, that the costs for the production and deployment of the lamps at the site of the customer in connection with this measure will amount to EUR 1.9 million in total. The management board assumes that these costs are covered by existing provisions. There are additional costs relating to the installation and removal, which are expected to be covered by the existing product liability insurance. Based on currently available information, the management board cannot exclude that customers may incur additional costs for which the company is liable without being able to take recourse against third parties and that the total costs of these measures might have a negative impact on the corporate results of the current financial year and the following financial years. If and to what extent the financial result will ultimately be strained, depends on the actual amount and nature of the costs resulting from the replacement of lamps, but also on the successful assertion of warranty claims towards the supplier of the polycarbonate-tubes.

Following the finally determined, externally verified data for our applications for the free allocation of CO2 allowances that are due for submission at the end of June, we assume that the allowances purchased by us as a precautionary measure will compensate the estimated shortfall for the most part in respect of the subsidiary companies of Salzgitter AG that are subject to the emission trading system. As it is not certain whether - and in the event when - technical CO2 mitigation options will be available, this procedure considered to be of an equal standing by the emission trading system was taken. The market value of all CO2 allowances acquired as a precautionary measure exceeds the figure accounted for in the balance sheet as of today's date by around EUR 300 million. They therefore constitute an asset that cannot be derived from the balance sheet. Consequently, we decided to publish this information in the form of an ad-hoc release.

These developments indirectly affect important customers of Siltronic AG, which have therefore significantly reduced orders for the second half of 2019. Accordingly, the Executive Board of Siltronic AG has decided today on an adjustment of the financial forecast for 2019. With ASPs 2019 in Euro being slightly higher compared to 2018, the Executive Board assumes the following development for the full year 2019: - Depending on the further market development including exchange rate effects, sales 2019 will be around 10 percent to 15 percent below the previous year (prior: minus 5 percent to minus 10 percent). - EBITDA margin should be between 30 percent and 35 percent (prior: between 33 percent and 37 percent). - Net cash flow will be clearly positive but decrease by approximately EUR 180 million (prior: approximately EUR 150 million) compared to 2018. In 2020, net cash flow will significantly increase. As expected, sales in Q2 2019 will be significantly below Q1. In Q3 2019 a further decrease is expected. Irrespective of the current market weakness, the Executive Board is convinced that Siltronic AG as technology leader in the wafer industry is well positioned to benefit from the future growth of the technological megatrends like digitization, Big Data, e-mobility and artificial intelligence. Siltronic AG will report the results for the first half of 2019 on July 25, 2019.

In addition to other customary conditions, the public takeover offer shall be subject to a minimum acceptance rate of 20 % and obtaining of merger control clearance and other regulatory approvals.

Altdorf, 12 June 2019 - Orascom Development Holding (ODH) is pleased to announce that its largest subsidiary in Egypt, Orascom Development Egypt (ODE) has signed a CHF 228.1 million debt rescheduling package, strengthening its balance sheet and creating more flexibility in advancing its projects. The transaction involves the immediate cash payment of CHF 19.5 million out of a total CHF 38.9 million, with the remaining to be paid by end of June 2019. ODE's lenders agreed to reduce the interest rate margin on the foreign currency debt by 100 bps. This will reduce our weighted average cost of debt from 9.0% to 8.1% and result in savings of CHF 4 million (EGP 70 million) in interest payments for 2019 and a total of CHF 19 million (EGP 320 million) over the 6 years period (2019-2024). The rescheduling terms and conditions also entails amending the remaining debt principal repayment schedule to better match the cash flow generation profile of ODE and alleviates the pressure without changing the final maturities of the loans by sculpting a ""ballooned"" structure whereby roughly 50% of the total debt principal is repaid in the final years. *All rates used were as of 31st of May 2019 About Orascom Development Holding (ODH): Orascom Development Holding (ODH) is a leading developer of fully integrated destinations that include hotels, private villas and apartments, leisure facilities such as golf courses, marinas and supporting infrastructure.

Press Release Orascom Development's Holding (ODH) largest subsidiary in Egypt, Orascom Development Egypt (ODE) has successfully signed CHF 228.1 million debt rescheduling package with the Egyptian banks. Altdorf, 12 June 2019 - Orascom Development Holding (ODH) is pleased to announce that its largest subsidiary in Egypt, Orascom Development Egypt (ODE) has signed a CHF 228.1 million debt rescheduling package, strengthening its balance sheet and creating more flexibility in advancing its projects. The transaction involves the immediate cash payment of CHF 19.5 million out of a total CHF 38.9 million, with the remaining to be paid by end of June 2019. ODE's lenders agreed to reduce the interest rate margin on the foreign currency debt by 100 bps. This will reduce our weighted average cost of debt from 9.0% to 8.1% and result in savings of CHF 4 million (EGP 70 million) in interest payments for 2019 and a total of CHF 19 million (EGP 320 million) over the 6 years period (2019-2024). The rescheduling terms and conditions also entails amending the remaining debt principal repayment schedule to better match the cash flow generation profile of ODE and alleviates the pressure without changing the final maturities of the loans by sculpting a ""ballooned"" structure whereby roughly 50% of the total debt principal is repaid in the final years. *All rates used were as of 31st of May 2019 About Orascom Development Holding (ODH): Orascom Development Holding (ODH) is a leading developer of fully integrated destinations that include hotels, private villas and apartments, leisure facilities such as golf courses, marinas and supporting infrastructure.

385310,Polyphor AG,Schweiz,Polyphor presents new in-vivo efficacy and tolerability data for a potential inhaled administration of its lead antibiotic murepavadin at the European Cystic Fibrosis Conference ,CH0106213793,1156813,"MEDIA RELEASE Allschwil, Switzerland, June 7, 2019 Polyphor presents new in-vivo efficacy and tolerability data for a potential inhaled administration of its lead antibiotic murepavadin at the European Cystic Fibrosis Conference Polyphor AG (SIX: POLN) presented yesterday new data from pulmonary delivery of its lead antibacterial candidate of the novel Outer Membrane Protein Targeting Antibiotic (OMPTA) class, murepavadin, at the 42nd European Cystic Fibrosis Conference in Liverpool, United Kingdom. The results from an in vivo study, which investigated the pharmacokinetics, tolerability and efficacy of murepavadin in neutropenic mouse lung infection models against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), demonstrated linear, dose proportional, pharmacokinetics when administered by intratracheal application. Exposure of the epithelial lining fluid to murepavadin was favorable compared to that in plasma. Murepavadin displayed potent activity toward PA infections when delivered intratracheally. Initial experiments further suggest that murepavadin was well tolerated when administered by inhalation route. In order to support and accelerate the development of a novel inhaled formulation of murepavadin, Polyphor is leveraging a European program dedicated to the development of inhaled antibiotics, iABC (inhaled Antibiotics in Bronchiectasis and Cystic fibrosis). The iABC project is a Europe-wide program run by a consortium of leading lung specialists in 18 hospitals and research institutions in eight European countries. These institutions will receive up to EUR 5 million funding for this project, under grant agreement 115721 from the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a public-private partnership of EFPIA (European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations) and the EU, while Polyphor will invest up to EUR 5 million. ""Respiratory infections, especially those caused by drug-resistant bacteria, are the main cause of disease and death in people with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. New treatment options are urgently needed to fight resistant pathogens, especially resistant Pseudomonas strains,"" commented Daniel Obrecht, Chief Scientific Officer of Polyphor. ""Murepavadin is a precision antibiotic specifically targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the main cause of chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis. The in vivo data presented are encouraging and we are looking forward to further developing the inhaled formulation of murepavadin within the iABC project, which will be an important step to find a new treatment option to improve the quality of life and increase life expectancy of these patients.""

Toward this end, 4SC is planning a cash capital increase by way of a rights offering to existing shareholders. A total of up to 15,324,256 new shares will be offered for subscription; new shares not subscribed for will be offered for sale to international institutional investors (together the ""Offering""). Capital increase by way of a rights offering 4SC has resolved to prepare an increase of its share capital through the utilization of authorized capital from EUR 30,648,513.00 by up to EUR 15,324,256.00 to a maximum of up to EUR 45,972,769.00, by issuing up to 15,324,256 new no-par value bearer shares, each with a notional par value of EUR 1.00, against cash contribution. The new shares (the ""Offer Shares"") will be offered to the existing shareholders by MainFirst Bank AG, Frankfurt am Main, by way of an indirect subscription right. The subscription ratio will be 2:1, which means 2 existing shares entitle the holder to subscribe for 1 new share. There shall be no organized trading in subscription rights. The subscription period is scheduled to begin on 13 June 2019 and end on 26 June 2019 midnight (24:00 hrs. CEST).

Toward this end, 4SC is planning a cash capital increase by way of a rights offering to existing shareholders. A total of up to 15,324,256 new shares will be offered for subscription; new shares not subscribed for will be offered for sale to international institutional investors (together the ""Offering""). Capital increase by way of a rights offering 4SC has resolved to prepare an increase of its share capital through the utilization of authorized capital from EUR 30,648,513.00 by up to EUR 15,324,256.00 to a maximum of up to EUR 45,972,769.00, by issuing up to 15,324,256 new no-par value bearer shares, each with a notional par value of EUR 1.00, against cash contribution. The new shares (the ""Offer Shares"") will be offered to the existing shareholders by MainFirst Bank AG, Frankfurt am Main, by way of an indirect subscription right. The subscription ratio will be 2:1, which means 2 existing shares entitle the holder to subscribe for 1 new share. There shall be no organized trading in subscription rights. The subscription period is scheduled to begin on 13 June 2019 and end on 26 June 2019 midnight (24:00 hrs. CEST). The subscription price per new share is expected to be determined on 21 June 2019, taking into account the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of 4SC AG in the XETRA electronic trading system on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange from the beginning of the subscription period on 13 June 2019 until the close of trading on 20 June 2019, less a potential discount yet to be determined, but in any case the subscription price will not exceed EUR 4.00. Offer Shares not subscribed for in the Offering will be offered for sale to international institutional investors in private placements after the end of the subscription period. To the extent the Offer Shares are not allocated in the private placement, shareholders who have issued subscription offers for further Offer Shares (over-subscription) may receive additional Offer Shares. 4SC aims to raise total net proceeds of between EUR 35 and 40 million from the Offering. Rights Offering and Securities Prospectus Additional details concerning the Offering will be made available in the formal subscription offer (Bezugsrechtsangebot) which is expected to be published in the Federal Gazette on or about 12 June 2019 and will also be accessible on the website of 4SC at www.4sc.com from that day. The public offering of shares from the Offering and the admission of the Offer Shares from the capital increase to trading on the Regulated Market (Prime Standard Market) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange are being conducted based on a securities prospectus which is expected to be approved by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) today, on 11 June 2019. Thus, the Offering and the admission of the Offer Shares to trading are subject to such BaFin approval. The prospectus will then be made accessible on the website of 4SC AG at www.4sc.com. MainFirst Bank AG will act as European Bookrunner in the Offering. ------------------------- Forward-looking information Information set forth in this press release contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties.

375410,Staramba SE,Deutschland,Staramba SE: Notification of loss pursuant to Section 92 (1) AktG; sales and EBITDA in fiscal year 2018 significantly lower than originally assumed due to treatment of token sales as advance payments received ,DE000A1K03W5,1155241,"Staramba SE: Notification of loss pursuant to Section 92 (1) AktG; sales and EBITDA in fiscal year 2018 significantly lower than originally assumed due to treatment of token sales as advance payments received - sales in the amount of approximately EUR 0.3 million instead of the forecast EUR 17.6 million, EBITDA EUR -11.1 million instead of EUR 5.7 million Berlin, 04 June 2019 The Board of Directors of Staramba SE (XETRA: 99SC) has today determined, in the course of the work on the preparation of the financial statements for the 2018 financial year, that the existence of a loss of more than half of the share capital of the Company as at 31 December 2018 is to be assumed. For this reason, the Board of Directors will immediately convene an Extraordinary General Meeting and notify it of the loss of more than half of the share capital pursuant to Section 92 (1) AktG. At this Annual General Meeting, the Board of Directors will explain the situation of the company to the shareholders. The reason for the shortfall of half of the share capital is changes to the annual financial statements as of December 31, 2018, which had to be made in the course of the preparation of the annual financial statements and which had an impact on the sales and EBITDA of the Company in fiscal year 2018. After intensive consultations with the responsible auditor and external experts, and following a reclassification under commercial law, it was decided not to immediately recognize the STARAMBA.Token sales from the ICO in fiscal year 2018 as sales. The STARAMBA.Tokens sold will be reported in the annual financial statements for the 2018 fiscal year as advance payments received and will therefore lead to a sales entry at a later date. In the press release dated February 13, 2019, reference was made to these (commercial and tax) uncertainties with respect to the token sales; in addition, the Company had already reported extensively on these concerns in its 2017 financial statements. Based on the current state of knowledge, the Board of Directors assumes that the treatment of token sales as advance payments received will result in a reduction in the sales forecast on 13 February 2019 for the 2018 financial year from previously around EUR 17.6 million to around EUR 330,000. On this basis, STARAMBA SE closed fiscal 2018 with EBITDA of approximately EUR -11.1 million. This represents a decrease of EUR 16.8 million compared to the last forecast of approximately EUR 5.7 million. As a result of these balance sheet adjustments, it must be assumed from the current perspective that a loss of more than half of the share capital within the meaning of Section 92 (1) AktG has occurred as of December 31, 2018. The Board of Directors is currently examining various options for measures to strengthen equity capital in order to counter the above-mentioned situation as quickly as possible and to eliminate half of the loss of share capital. The publication of the complete annual financial statements for the 2018 financial year is scheduled for 28 June 2019.

As part of the capital increase transaction, three of SFC's largest shareholders (HPE PRO Institutional Fund B.V. (HPE), Havensight Capital Ltd. (Havensight) and Conduit Ventures IIA LP (Conduit Ventures)), which together have a shareholding of approx. 41.7% in the Company's SFC's share capital, agreed that they would waive their subscription rights and have subjected themselves, at customary conditions, to a lock-up of 180 days, consisting of (i) a so-called hard lock-up agreement for a period of 90 days, which shall not be waived by the Joint Global Coordinators; and (ii) a so-called soft lock-up agreement for a further period of 90 days which may be waived by the Joint Global Coordinators. The new shares will be offered for sale in a private placement to qualified investors and will, to the extent not relating to waived subscription rights from the three large shareholders, be subject to a claw-back structure. The offer price per share for the private placement as well as the subscription price will be determined on the outcome of a pre-placement process by way of an accelerated bookbuilding. The offer price and the subscription price will be identical. The exact amount of shares to be placed as well as the offer and subscription price per share will not be determined before the outcome of the bookbuilding. The private placement to qualified investors and the subscription period are expected to commence end of June 2019 following approval by the German Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) of a prospectus for the subscription offer and the listing of the new shares.

ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft are acting as Joint Global Coordinators on the Offering, B. Metzler seel. Sohn & Co. KGaA is acting as selling agent.

OTI Greentech AG announces that it has received written commitments from some of its creditors to convert their granted loans (including accrued interest) into newly issued shares of OTI Greentech AG through a capital increase by contribution in kind. These commitments account for 48% of the total principal loan amount of around EUR 2.4 million. The conversion is to take place in a ratio of EUR 1 debt to EUR 1 equity. The commitments are the result of the preceding discussions between OTI Greentech AG and its subsidiary OTI Greentech Innovative Solutions AG (CH) and its creditors regarding the outstanding principal loan amounts of around EUR 1 million and EUR 1.4 million respectively. The aim of the Company is that the remaining 3 creditors and the holders of the EUR 2.9m convertible bonds issued by OTI Greentech AG also agree to convert their loans or bonds into equity. The existing received commitments are subject to the condition that these creditors also commit to the conversion. To this effect, the Supervisory Board of OTI Greentech AG today resolved to authorise the Management Board to enter into an agreement with all holders of the convertible bonds the purpose of which is to (i) amend the conversion price to EUR 1 (as approved by the general meeting of shareholders on 11 September 2018) and (ii) to extend the special termination right granted to the bondholders from 31 May 2019 until 15 July 2019, which is intended to give the company sufficient time to gather the conversion declarations from all bondholders. The agreement and the conversion declarations will be sent to the bondholders in the next days. On the assumption that the Company receives the required conversion declarations from all bondholders, the conversion is expected to be completed latest by 15 July 2019. The conversion of the normal loans by way of capital increase against contributions in kind will then be initiated and is expected to be completed by the end of August.

132,Infineon Technologies AG,Deutschland,Infineon Technologies AG: Infineon Technologies AG to acquire Cypress Semiconductor Corporation ,DE0006231004,1154509,"Infineon to acquire Cypress, strengthening and accelerating its path of profitable growth Munich, 3 June 2019 - Infineon Technologies AG (FSE: IFX / OTCQX: IFNNY) and Cypress Semiconductors Corporation (NASDAQ: CY) today announced that the companies have signed a definitive agreement under which Infineon will acquire Cypress for US$23.85 per share in cash, corresponding to an enterprise value of EUR9.0 billion. The offer price represents a 46 percent premium to Cypress' unaffected 30-day volume-weighted average price during the period from 15 April to 28 May 2019, the last trading day prior to media reports regarding a potential sale of Cypress. With the addition of Cypress, Infineon will consequently strengthen its focus on structural growth drivers and serve a broader range of applications. This will accelerate the company's path of profitable growth of recent years. The acquisition will also improve Infineon's financial strength and Infineon shareholders are expected to benefit from earnings accretion beginning in the first full fiscal year after closing. The capital intensity will decrease, resulting in an increasing free cash flow margin. Infineon has validated sales and cost synergies assumptions as part of due diligence. Expected economies of scale will create cost synergies of EUR180 million per annum by 2022. The complementary portfolios will enable the offering of further chip solutions with a revenue synergies potential of more than EUR1.5 billion per annum in the long term. Upon successful integration, Infineon will adapt its target operating model accordingly. Then, the company targets through-cycle revenue growth of 9+ percent and a segment result margin of 19 percent. The investment-to-sales ratio is targeted to decrease to 13 percent. The funding of the acquisition is fully underwritten by a consortium of banks. Infineon is committed to retaining a solid investment grade rating and, consequently, Infineon intends to ultimately finance approximately 30 percent of the total transaction value with equity and the remainder with debt as well as cash on hand. The financial policy to preserve a strategic cash reserve remains in place. The Board of Directors of Cypress and the Infineon Supervisory Board have already consented to the acquisition.

The offer price represents a 46 percent premium to Cypress' unaffected 30-day volume-weighted average price during the period from 15 April to 28 May 2019, the last trading day prior to media reports regarding a potential sale of Cypress. With the addition of Cypress, Infineon will consequently strengthen its focus on structural growth drivers and serve a broader range of applications. This will accelerate the company's path of profitable growth of recent years. The acquisition will also improve Infineon's financial strength and Infineon shareholders are expected to benefit from earnings accretion beginning in the first full fiscal year after closing. The capital intensity will decrease, resulting in an increasing free cash flow margin. Infineon has validated sales and cost synergies assumptions as part of due diligence. Expected economies of scale will create cost synergies of EUR180 million per annum by 2022. The complementary portfolios will enable the offering of further chip solutions with a revenue synergies potential of more than EUR1.5 billion per annum in the long term. Upon successful integration, Infineon will adapt its target operating model accordingly. Then, the company targets through-cycle revenue growth of 9+ percent and a segment result margin of 19 percent. The investment-to-sales ratio is targeted to decrease to 13 percent. The funding of the acquisition is fully underwritten by a consortium of banks. Infineon is committed to retaining a solid investment grade rating and, consequently, Infineon intends to ultimately finance approximately 30 percent of the total transaction value with equity and the remainder with debt as well as cash on hand. The financial policy to preserve a strategic cash reserve remains in place. The Board of Directors of Cypress and the Infineon Supervisory Board have already consented to the acquisition. The acquisition is subject to approval by the relevant regulatory bodies and Cypress' shareholders as well as other customary conditions.

With a revenue increase of around 10 percent to 70.9 million euros (Q2-YTD-17/18: 64.7 million euros), a strong EBT growth of 17 percent to 14.9 million euros (Q2-YTD-17/18: 12.7 million euros) compared to the same period last year and a related EBT margin of 21 percent of revenues (Q2-YTD-17/18: 20 %), the company is taking a further step towards its medium-term sales target of ""200+"". EBITDA increased significantly by 20 percent with a margin of 34 percent of revenues (Q2-YTD-17/18: 31 %), while EBIT improved by 17 percent and reached a margin of 21 percent of revenues (Q2-YTD-17/18: 20 %). In addition to a significant increase in operating cash flow to 16.3 million euros (Q2-YTD-17/18: 12.6 million euros), ISRA recorded a net cash flow of 9.0 million euros and net liquidity of 4.1 million euros (September 30, 2018: 1.8 million euros). Unless otherwise stated, this document includes EBITDA, EBIT and EBT before one-time acquisition costs (0.9 million euros). As described in the previous section, the positive margin level in operating business was successfully increased further in the second quarter of the current financial year. The gross margin (total output minus material and labor costs of production) rose by 2 percentage points to 63 percent of total output (Q2-YTD-17/18: 61 %). EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) increased by 20 percent to 24.4 million euros (Q2-YTD-17/18: 20.4 million euros), the EBITDA margin in relation to total output reached 31 percent (Q2-YTD-17/18: 29 %). EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) rose by 17 percent to 15.0 million euros (Q2-YTD-17/18: 12.9 million euros), corresponding to a margin of 19 percent of total output (Q2-YTD-17/18: 18 %). EBT (earnings before taxes) also improved by 17 percent to 14.9 million euros (Q2-YTD-17/18: 12.7 million euros), which corresponds to an EBT margin of 19 percent referenced to total output (Q2-YTD-17/18: 18 %). The half-year figures reflect good order entries and a strong order backlog of currently 98 million euros gross (PY: 95 million euros gross). Inventories increase slightly to 38.5 million euros (September 30, 2018: 36.9 million euros). Total trade receivables fall slightly to 104.5 million euros (September 30, 2018: 111.8 million euros) with cash receivables amounting to 38.8 million euros (September 30, 2018: 45.5 million euros) and contract assets to 65.7 million euros (receivables according to the percentage of completion method on September 30, 2018: 66.3 million euros). Net liquidity evolves to 4.1 million euros (September 30, 2018: 1.8 million euros). Continuing measures to improve efficiency, in particular in production, resulted in an increase in cash flow: Cash flow from operating activities totals 16.3 million euros (Q2-YTD-17/18: 12.6 million euros) and net cash flow 9.0 million euros after distribution of dividends to shareholders amounting to 3.3 million euros (Q2-YTD-17/18: 5.2 million euros prior to distribution). The earnings per share (EPS) after taxes hereby improved by 12 percent to 0.46 euros (Q2-YTD-17/18: 0.41 euros). Shareholders also benefit from the positive development of the company: The Annual General Meeting adopted the proposal from the Executive Board and Supervisory Board on March 19 and approved the 27 percent increase in dividend to 0.15 euros per share for the 2017/2018 financial year. With significantly higher equity of 203.7 million euros (September 30, 2018: 197.8 million euros), an equity ratio up by 2 percentage points to 65 percent (September 30, 2018: 63 %) and the available credit lines, ISRA has very good capital resources for future growth and for financing potential acquisition projects. Consistent investments in the company's global expansion, the extension of market shares in relevant industries and the strengthening of its international teams at over 25 locations all contributed to the positive business development in the first half of 2018/2019. ISRA has newly formed its business team in England and has intensified the market expansion in Eastern Europe. The management is also currently examining new opportunities for further growth in North and South America, as well as in India. In the second quarter of 2018/2019, business development in the regions maintained the positive momentum of the first three months: In the European markets, ISRA recorded an increase in business in the reporting period, to which in particular successes in France contributed. Sales in Asia developed well in double-digit range compared with the second quarter of 2017/2018, amongst others backed by major orders from China. Business in North and South America is at a similarly good level as in the previous year and will be further expanded in the coming months by strengthening management and intensifying marketing and sales activities. In the first half of 2018/19, revenue in the Industrial Automation segment rose to 17.2 million euros, growing by 8 percent compared to the same period of the previous year (Q2-YTD-17/18: 15.9 million euros). EBIT increased by 18 percent to 3.6 million euros (Q2-YTD-17/18: 3.1 million euros) at an EBIT margin of 18 percent of total output (Q2-YTD-17/18: 18 %). Machine Vision solutions for robot-guided assembly and measurement technology are the main drivers of the segment's results. In the coming months additional momentum is expected to come from portfolio enhancements in the field of smart factory automation and a strengthened presence in new markets for connected automation. ISRA recently launched product innovations in the market for 3D surface inspection with integrated precision metrology for discrete industries, such as the automotive, electronics or display industries. In the first half of 2018/2019, sales in the Surface Vision segment grew by 10 percent to 53.8 million euros (Q2-YTD-17/18: 48.8 million euros). EBIT rose to 11.4 million euros (Q2-YTD-17/18: 9.8 million euros), which corresponds to an EBIT margin of 19 percent of total output (Q2-YTD-17/18: 18 %). One important growth area is the metal inspection business, which benefits from the complete portfolio strategy and strategic management reinforcement. The company is opening up additional market potential with the further development of INDUSTRIE 4.0 capable systems for networked production. In the glass industry, the positive order situation continues with product innovations for the inspection of thin glass for the display, solar and automotive industries. Extensions to the high-end inspection portfolio for the precise inspection of float glass are also expected to create further momentum. Advanced materials (formerly plastics) recorded strong growth with the development of new markets through the expanded focus on the inspection of innovative materials. In the print segment, the digital print inspection business achieved robust sales. Following the successful conclusion of a major order for the inspection of the cell production of a well-known Chinese manufacturer, additional growth impulses are emerging in the solar industry. In the paper sector, ISRA is concentrating on future markets such as the packaging industry and is optimizing its innovative portfolio with cost-reducing embedded technologies while simultaneously strengthening its activities in marketing and sales. Demand in the security business was similar to that of the previous year, with specialized inspection systems for high-security paper and printing. Following the successful closing of strategically important projects for leading European manufacturers, ISRA is concentrating on the Asian region in the still young semiconductor business segment. In the second quarter, the service business contributed a double-digit share of sales to the positive development of the company, which is to be increased further as part of the internationalization of customer service support and an expansion of management in the coming weeks. ISRA started the 2018/2019 financial year well with highly profitable revenue performance during the first six months. In addition to consistent organic growth, acquisitions remain a key element of the expansion strategy. These activities are focused on target companies whose expertise will bring a sustained advance in ISRA's technology leadership, strengthen its market position or open up new markets. In order to avoid possible acquisition risks the company examines every project with the necessary caution, which may lead to delays. In this context due diligence processes are sometimes time-consuming, not least due to market fluctuations and the associated valuation variations. Targets from the areas of industrial automation, production analytics and INDUSTRIE 4.0 sensors are currently being examined in more detail. In addition to organic and external growth, the management sees significant sales potential through the consistent expansion of the innovative product portfolio with INDUSTRIE 4.0 architecture for the expansion of the new business areas Smart Factory Automation and Production Analytics. With its strategic focus on future-oriented expansion of the innovation portfolio, an enlargement of its activities in the global markets and a strong order backlog of currently 98 million euros gross, ISRA is well-positioned for a successful second half of the year. The focus will also be on expanding the international presence and global market position through new vertical industrial sectors. At the same time, management is concentrating on efficiently optimizing production and cash flow. The medium-term exceeding of the 200 million euros sales mark remains an important strategic goal of the company. In order to react appropriately and quickly to emerging global risks, the relevant markets are closely monitored, various scenarios are anticipated and marketing and sales are systematically expanded. Provided that the global economic environment does not deteriorate significantly - this also includes current trade policy tensions - ISRA still plans to achieve its projected low double-digit growth for revenues and earnings with at least stable margins.

With its strategic focus on future-oriented expansion of the innovation portfolio, an enlargement of its activities in the global markets and a strong order backlog of currently 98 million euros gross, ISRA is well-positioned for a successful second half of the year. The focus will also be on expanding the international presence and global market position through new vertical industrial sectors. At the same time, management is concentrating on efficiently optimizing production and cash flow. The medium-term exceeding of the 200 million euros sales mark remains an important strategic goal of the company. In order to react appropriately and quickly to emerging global risks, the relevant markets are closely monitored, various scenarios are anticipated and marketing and sales are systematically expanded. Provided that the global economic environment does not deteriorate significantly - this also includes current trade policy tensions - ISRA still plans to achieve its projected low double-digit growth for revenues and earnings with at least stable margins.",2019-06-03 07:55:00,https://dgap.de/dgap/News/adhoc/isra-right-track-strong-first-halfyear-and-high-backlog-confirm-annual-guidance/?companyID=444&newsID=1154535,548810
108312,AEVIS VICTORIA SA,Schweiz,"AEVIS VICTORIA SA: new strategic partner for Infracore, alongside AEVIS and Baloise Group ",CH0478634105,1152877,"Press release Fribourg, 27 May 2019 AEVIS VICTORIA SA: new strategic partner for Infracore, alongside AEVIS and Baloise Group Baloise Group increases its participating interest to 35% and Medical Properties Trust acquires a stake of 46% in Infracore SA Within the process initiated at the beginning of the year, AEVIS VICTORIA (AEVIS) has successfully placed 61% of the share capital of Infracore SA (Infracore), its subsidiary dedicated to medical infrastructure. Baloise Group, which entered into the share-capital of Infracore in December 2018, increases its participation from 20% to 35%. Medical Properties Trust (MPT) takes a 46% stake in Infracore. As a strategic player in the global hospital real estate market, MPT was chosen for its experience and international presence, particularly in Europe. With Baloise Group and MPT, AEVIS forms a long-term partnership for the development of Infracore. Baloise Group and Medical Properties Trust, two strategic shareholders for Infracore Following a private placement process initiated in March 2019, AEVIS sold 61% of Infracore's share capital and retains a 19% stake. The Infracore shares were placed at a price of CHF 51 per share, valuing the company at approximately CHF 1 billion. In addition to Baloise Group, which increased its participation from 20% to 35%, MPT, a strategic investor listed on the New York Stock Exchange and exclusively specialised in hospital buildings for nearly 20 years, acquired a 46% stake in Infracore. With its independent and strengthened shareholder base, Infracore will remain Swiss Medical Network's preferred partner in the very long term to support its growth and strategy. Further to that, Infracore strengthens its unique ability to offer attractive solutions for the public and private healthcare infrastructure sector throughout Switzerland. Strengthened balance sheet for AEVIS Following this sale, AEVIS will post a consolidated Swiss GAAP FER profit of more than CHF 210 million in the first half year of 2019 and will see its net debt decrease by nearly CHF 700 million to CHF 360 million. With the deconsolidation of Infracore, AEVIS sees its balance sheet total at 30 June 2019 reduced to CHF 1.3 billion. AEVIS' consolidated shareholders' equity will thus be strengthened to more than 48%. The sale of 61% of Infracore will allow the additional distribution of reserves of CHF 3.80 per share, which will be proposed to the shareholders who convene in General Meeting today. AEVIS will have cash reserves and credit lines of nearly CHF 300 million, enabling the company to support the growth of its subsidiaries and invest in its strategic infrastructure, healthcare and lifestyle activities. Focus on operational optimisation Swiss Medical Network, AEVIS' operating subsidiary in the hospital sector, has significantly reduced its costs and improved its profitability, despite regulatory constraints and pricing pressures. Swiss Medical Network will continue to grow and to play its role as a consolidator in the healthcare sector, thus enabling the emergence of an integrated healthcare player in Switzerland, presenting a virtuous alternative to the current system. Digitalisation and new technologies are priorities for Swiss Medical Network and its decentralised, agile and patient-friendly development strategy. Victoria-Jungfrau Collection, AEVIS' hospitality subsidiary, is also pursuing its development and will soon reopen the Hotel Eden at Lake in Zurich, after a complete renovation. The catering offer receives particular attention, as it has become a strategic priority for all Victoria-Jungfrau Collection's hotels. General Meeting of Shareholders AEVIS will hold its General Meeting of Shareholders for the 2018 financial year today at 15:00 in Interlaken. In addition to the regular agenda items, shareholders will decide on an ordinary distribution of CHF 1.10 per share, an additional distribution of CHF 3.80 related to the private placement of Infracore shares and the division by five of the nominal value of the shares (share split). The latter measure aims to increase the liquidity and attractiveness of the share. For further information: AEVIS VICTORIA SA Media and Investor Relations: c/o Dynamics Group, Zurich Philippe R.

385310,Polyphor AG,Schweiz,Polyphor and the University of Zurich receive an award from Innosuisse to accelerate the development of a new class of antibiotics inhibiting the LPS transport pathway ,CH0106213793,1153599,"Allschwil, Switzerland, May 29, 2019 Polyphor and the University of Zurich receive an award from Innosuisse to accelerate the development of a new class of antibiotics inhibiting the LPS transport pathway Polyphor and the University of Zurich (UZH) announce today that Innosuisse, the Swiss Innovation Agency, has awarded a significant grant for the innovation project ""Development of a new class of antibiotics inhibiting the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) transport pathway"". Innosuisse, formerly known as CTI (Commission of Technology and Innovation) helps to fund innovation projects carried out by companies in cooperation with research institutions. The Innosuisse award will finance the salaries and material costs of Polyphor's project partner UZH, whereas Polyphor will provide an additional contribution, of which a substantial part will be in kind. The research is independent from the project recently funded by Carb-X and the Novo Repair Fund. The project funded by Innosuisse is based on a novel discovery of Prof. John Robinson and Prof. Oliver Zerbe from the UZH concerning the molecular target and mode-of-action of the natural antimicrobial peptide thanatin. Thanatin inhibits the lipopolysaccharide transport protein A (LptA), which is critically involved in the transport of LPS from the periplasm to the outer membrane and of vital relevance to the bacteria. ""This collaboration is a unique opportunity for the UZH and Polyphor to jointly develop antibiotics against priority 1 Gram-negative bacteria to treat infections with high unmet medical need,"" said Oliver Zerbe, Chief Investigator of the project. ""We are delighted to have obtained the support from Innosuisse, which is a further proof of the potential of our technology platform. This project will allow us to continue a highly fruitful collaboration with the UZH which started in 2000 with a first grant from Innosuisse to develop the protein epitope mimetics (PEM) technology, from which all of Polyphor's current drug portfolio has been developed. Thanatin analogues may lead to another family of compounds inhibiting the outer membrane assembly through a different mechanism than other OMPTAs developed so far,"" said Daniel Obrecht, Chief Scientific Officer and co-Founder of Polyphor. Polyphor has discovered, leveraging its macrocycle platform, a new class of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria with a novel mode of action, the Outer Membrane Protein Targeting Antibiotics (OMPTA). The most advanced drug candidate of this new class is murepavadin (POL7080), a highly potent antibiotic in clinical development targeting Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, including its most resistant strains, followed by the next generation OMPTAs (lead candidate: POL7306), now in advanced pre-clinical testing, which are medium-spectrum antibiotics targeting the most important Gram-negative pathogens, including extensively drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant strains.

It has discovered and is developing the OMPTA (Outer Membrane Protein Targeting Antibiotics). The OMPTA are potentially the first new class of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria to have reached Phase III stage in the last 50 years. The company's lead OMPTA, murepavadin, (POL7080) is in Phase III development against Pseudomonas aeruginosa - recognized as a critical priority 1 pathogen by WHO; in addition, Polyphor is developing a pipeline of further preclinical antibiotics based on its OMPTA platform. In addition, Polyphor is developing an immuno-oncology candidate, balixafortide (POL6326), which is starting a Phase III trial in combination with eribulin in patients with advanced breast cancer, and exploring in parallel its potential for further combinations and indications.

Allschwil, Switzerland, May 29, 2019 Polyphor and the University of Zurich receive an award from Innosuisse to accelerate the development of a new class of antibiotics inhibiting the LPS transport pathway Polyphor and the University of Zurich (UZH) announce today that Innosuisse, the Swiss Innovation Agency, has awarded a significant grant for the innovation project ""Development of a new class of antibiotics inhibiting the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) transport pathway"". Innosuisse, formerly known as CTI (Commission of Technology and Innovation) helps to fund innovation projects carried out by companies in cooperation with research institutions. The Innosuisse award will finance the salaries and material costs of Polyphor's project partner UZH, whereas Polyphor will provide an additional contribution, of which a substantial part will be in kind. The research is independent from the project recently funded by Carb-X and the Novo Repair Fund. The project funded by Innosuisse is based on a novel discovery of Prof. John Robinson and Prof. Oliver Zerbe from the UZH concerning the molecular target and mode-of-action of the natural antimicrobial peptide thanatin. Thanatin inhibits the lipopolysaccharide transport protein A (LptA), which is critically involved in the transport of LPS from the periplasm to the outer membrane and of vital relevance to the bacteria. ""This collaboration is a unique opportunity for the UZH and Polyphor to jointly develop antibiotics against priority 1 Gram-negative bacteria to treat infections with high unmet medical need,"" said Oliver Zerbe, Chief Investigator of the project. ""We are delighted to have obtained the support from Innosuisse, which is a further proof of the potential of our technology platform. This project will allow us to continue a highly fruitful collaboration with the UZH which started in 2000 with a first grant from Innosuisse to develop the protein epitope mimetics (PEM) technology, from which all of Polyphor's current drug portfolio has been developed. Thanatin analogues may lead to another family of compounds inhibiting the outer membrane assembly through a different mechanism than other OMPTAs developed so far,"" said Daniel Obrecht, Chief Scientific Officer and co-Founder of Polyphor. Polyphor has discovered, leveraging its macrocycle platform, a new class of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria with a novel mode of action, the Outer Membrane Protein Targeting Antibiotics (OMPTA). The most advanced drug candidate of this new class is murepavadin (POL7080), a highly potent antibiotic in clinical development targeting Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, including its most resistant strains, followed by the next generation OMPTAs (lead candidate: POL7306), now in advanced pre-clinical testing, which are medium-spectrum antibiotics targeting the most important Gram-negative pathogens, including extensively drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant strains.

It has discovered and is developing the OMPTA (Outer Membrane Protein Targeting Antibiotics). The OMPTA are potentially the first new class of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria to have reached Phase III stage in the last 50 years. The company's lead OMPTA, murepavadin, (POL7080) is in Phase III development against Pseudomonas aeruginosa - recognized as a critical priority 1 pathogen by WHO; in addition, Polyphor is developing a pipeline of further preclinical antibiotics based on its OMPTA platform. In addition, Polyphor is developing an immuno-oncology candidate, balixafortide (POL6326), which is starting a Phase III trial in combination with eribulin in patients with advanced breast cancer, and exploring in parallel its potential for further combinations and indications. Polyphor is based in Allschwil near Basel and is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX: POLN). For more information, please visit www.polyphor.com.

QSC AG today updated its forecast for the 2019 financial year as a whole to account for the agreement reached on 6 May 2019 concerning the sale of its telecommunications subsidiary Plusnet. Based on the transaction-related effects currently foreseeable, and in particular the deconsolidation of Plusnet involved in the sale, QSC expects to generate revenues of more than EUR 255 million, EBITDA of more than EUR 145 million and a free cash flow of more than EUR 130 million in the 2019 financial year. Prior to the Plusnet sale, the Company had expected to generate revenues of more than EUR 350 million, EBITDA of more than EUR 65 million and a positive free cash flow in a low single-digit million euro range. The new forecast is based on the assumption that the transaction will be executed as of 31 July 2019, subject to approval by the antitrust authorities and fulfilment of further closing conditions. The new EBITDA forecast includes a deconsolidation gain, including transaction and migration costs associated with the Plusnet sale, that is estimated at EUR 110 million. The deconsolidation gain itself mainly comprises accounting gains resulting from the difference between the agreed purchase price and the carrying amount. The free cash flow forecast includes the purchase price less liquidity thereby sold and also accounts for transaction and migration costs, including taxes, and future growth financing. QSC will use the liquidity received from the Plusnet sale to implement its growth strategy more rapidly, to make potential acquisitions aimed at supplementing its technology portfolio in a targeted manner and to fully repay its debt. The new revenue forecast is also based on the assumption that Plusnet is deconsolidated as of 31 July 2019. Apart from the Plusnet revenues originally planned and now set to be discontinued from 1 August 2019, the updated revenue forecast is consistent with the previous forecast.

The total operating performance will amount to around EUR 37 million. The earnings forecast for 2018 of an EBIT margin of 2 percent to 5 percent with a total operating performance of 40 million euros will not be achieved. In addition to one-off valuation adjustments, losses from operating activities also contributed to the negative EBIT result. The latter are due in particular to the dynamic price development for materials and services of the construction companies engaged in the drilling projects, the lack of specialist personnel for the company's own drilling rigs and the long frost period at the beginning of the 2018 financial year. In addition, the continuing delay in the final completion and commissioning of the Taufkirchen geothermal power plant had a negative impact on earnings. The power plant in Landau is running smoothly. As a consequence of the operating losses, the Executive Board is aiming for a realignment of the Group with a focus on the drilling services business and on partnership models in the power plant division, which corresponds to the medium-sized orientation of the Daldrup & Söhne Group. Daldrup acquired 22.88% of the shares in Geysir Europe GmbH with effect from 1 April 2019. Daldrup thus holds 97.89 % (previously 75.01 %) of the shares.

Frankfurt am Main, 21 May 2019 - Management board and supervisory board of VERIANOS Real Estate Aktiengesellschaft decided that the company shall be converted into a European Company (Societas Europaea, SE). It is intended to establish a one-tier system with an administrative organ instead of the current two-tier system consisting of a management board and a supervisory board. To change the legal form, it is inter alia necessary that the general meeting of VERIANOS Real Estate Aktiengesellschaft approves the terms of conversion including the future VERIANOS SE's articles of association in which the members of the first administrative organ will be appointed. Management board and supervisory board will propose the respective resolutions to the upcoming annual general meeting. Furthermore, the registration and effectiveness of the change of the legal form require completion or termination of the procedure of the negotiations for the involvement of employees within the future SE. With the new management structure, the significantly increased operational requirements are to be accommodated by a future broader range of products and funds as well by being a fully regulated AIF manager. The result for the financial year 2018 was determined with a consolidated net income of EUR 1,744,545.27 and is thus approx. 9% below the previous year's result. This reflects in particular the current market situation in Germany, which only allows a few buying opportunities for a value investor due to the historically high demand of many investors for real estate. After the current transition phase, VERIANOS is planning a significant expansion of its investment and business activities again in the coming years with the already initiated geographical and product-related diversification. Effective July 1, 2019 Tobias Bodamer was also appointed as a further member of the Management Board. Following positions at KPMG and Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt as well as London, Mr. Bodamer was most recently Managing Director and Head of Syndicate & Sales at IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG in Düsseldorf. His responsibilities at VERIANOS will focus on strengthening and expanding client relationships with institutional as well as private investors and on the development of new services for them.

Frankfurt am Main, 21 May 2019 - Management board and supervisory board of VERIANOS Real Estate Aktiengesellschaft decided that the company shall be converted into a European Company (Societas Europaea, SE). It is intended to establish a one-tier system with an administrative organ instead of the current two-tier system consisting of a management board and a supervisory board. To change the legal form, it is inter alia necessary that the general meeting of VERIANOS Real Estate Aktiengesellschaft approves the terms of conversion including the future VERIANOS SE's articles of association in which the members of the first administrative organ will be appointed. Management board and supervisory board will propose the respective resolutions to the upcoming annual general meeting. Furthermore, the registration and effectiveness of the change of the legal form require completion or termination of the procedure of the negotiations for the involvement of employees within the future SE. With the new management structure, the significantly increased operational requirements are to be accommodated by a future broader range of products and funds as well by being a fully regulated AIF manager. The result for the financial year 2018 was determined with a consolidated net income of EUR 1,744,545.27 and is thus approx. 9% below the previous year's result. This reflects in particular the current market situation in Germany, which only allows a few buying opportunities for a value investor due to the historically high demand of many investors for real estate. After the current transition phase, VERIANOS is planning a significant expansion of its investment and business activities again in the coming years with the already initiated geographical and product-related diversification. Effective July 1, 2019 Tobias Bodamer was also appointed as a further member of the Management Board. Following positions at KPMG and Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt as well as London, Mr. Bodamer was most recently Managing Director and Head of Syndicate & Sales at IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG in Düsseldorf. His responsibilities at VERIANOS will focus on strengthening and expanding client relationships with institutional as well as private investors and on the development of new services for them.

On March 27, 2019, United Internet AG announced that the company's Management Board and Supervisory Board would make a dividend proposal at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 23, 2019 that would take into account the outcome of the ongoing auction on the allocation of mobile frequencies in the 2 GHz and 3.6 GHz bands (""5G spectrum auction""). Accordingly, a dividend of 0.05 EUR per United Internet share was proposed in case that the United Internet subsidiary 1&1 Drillisch has successfully acquired spectrum in the auction by today, i.e., by May 20, 2019. The 5G spectrum auction is not yet finished and continues regardless of its already now historically long duration. Even after the expiry of today's deadline (May 20, 2019) it is therefore still not clear whether 1&1 Drillisch will acquire spectrum in the 5G spectrum auction. As announced on May 7, 2019 by the company for this case, the Management Board and Supervisory Board of United Internet have today resolved to propose to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting a dividend in the amount of 0.05 EUR per share. The objective of this precautionary measure is to ensure that the necessary additional investments can be made if 1&1 Drillisch will successfully acquire spectrum by the end of the 5G spectrum auction. The proposed dividend is based on the minimum dividend as prescribed by Section 254 (1) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). On the basis of 200.3 million shares with dividend entitlement (as of December 31, 2018), the total dividend payment for the fiscal year 2018 would amount to 10.01 million EUR.

The system, which involved a total investment of approximately 17 million euros, is supporting the stability of the German electricity network by providing frequency regulation services to the country's Primary Control Reserve (PCR) market. ""The Cremzow project demonstrates how storage is increasingly becoming an integral part of renewable energy systems due to its enabling role in making them more reliable, flexible and stable,"" said Antonio Cammisecra, Head of Enel Green Power. ""Leveraging on our expertise in the storage segment and the fruitful collaboration with our project partners, we launched this innovative storage system which allows us to contribute to the stability of the electricity transmission network around the clock in Germany, the heartland of the European PCR market."" Jörg Müller, CEO of ENERTRAG, highlights not only the project's daily contribution to the primary balancing purposes but also its possible contribution to security of supply. ""Cremzow BESS allows us to back up the renewable energy system in case a black start is necessary. Our consortium demonstrates that battery energy systems are profitable without subsidies. Renewable energy systems are mature."" Anil Srivastava, CEO of Leclanché, said: ""Cremzow is a landmark project which clearly demonstrates how energy storage solutions are solving some of the key challenges faced by our electricity grids today. We are delighted to be working with forward looking partners Enel Green Power and ENERTRAG, to deliver this important energy storage project which ensures the grid's stability and reliability, with the ambition of increasing the level of renewables in the grid and reducing curtailment."" The Cremzow BESS is providing the grid with a real-time primary frequency regulation service contributing to its stability. When the grid's frequency decreases due to high power demand, the battery is able to deliver its stored energy within 30 seconds, while in response to frequency increases due to low demand, the battery is charged with the surplus energy. Furthermore, the possibility to integrate the BESS with ENERTRAG wind farms, using the wind energy surplus to charge the batteries avoiding curtailments, is currently being studied. The BESS is owned by a special purpose vehicle (SPV) in which EGP Germany holds a 90% majority stake and ENERTRAG the remaining 10% stake. Leclanché acts as the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor for the project, in charge of integrating battery and power conversion systems and energy management software. The German PCR market has evolved greatly in recent years with the early 2017 auction of approximately 600 MW of FCR attracting bidders from Austria, Belgium, France, Netherlands and Switzerland, thereby confirming the market's cross-border appeal. As of May 2019, the tendered PCR capacity in Germany amounts to 605 MW. The introduction of battery storage systems is an important development in the German PCR market: in 2017, BESS provided about 200 MW of PCR, equal to about 31% of the market.

The Phase Ib trial investigated balixafortide in combination with eribulin in 56 patients with advanced HER2 negative MBC. The overall survival for the expanded cohort was 50% at 18 months and 33.3% at 24 months, whereas the overall survival for the overall efficacy population was 42.4% at 18 months and 25% at 24 months. These data are consistent with the positive trend of all efficacy read-outs observed in this study and safety information is consistent with what was previously reported. Although inter-trial comparisons should be interpreted with caution, these survival rates, especially for the expanded cohort, are higher than those reported for eribulin monotherapy in similar MBC populations.These promising results suggest that balixafortide in combination with eribulin could potentially provide a new treatment option in heavily pre-treated patients with HER2 negative MBC. The abstract will be presented during the session ""Development Immunotherapy and Tumor Immunobiology"", on June 1, 8:00 AM - 11:00 AM: Abstract number and title: #2606, poster Board: #250, ""Balixafortide (a CXCR4 antagonist) + eribulin in HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC): survival outcomes of the Phase I trial"".

CXCR4 plays a critical role in tumor growth, survival, angiogenesis and metastasis[i]. High CXCR4 levels have been detected in almost all human tumor types, including breast cancer. High CXCR4 expression is known to correlate with aggressive metastatic behavior of cancer cells and a poor prognosis[ii]. Balixafortide is being developed to improve therapy outcomes in cancer, when used in combination with other agents. Balixafortide is the only CXCR4 antagonist in development for breast cancer and is the most advanced CXCR4 antagonist, being developed in solid tumors, being the first product candidate to reach proof of concept. The molecule was discovered based on Polyphor's proprietary macrocycle technology platform. Balixafortide showed strong results in a Phase Ib/proof of concept clinical trial in combination with eribulin in patients affected with advanced metastatic breast cancer. The development path identified with the input of the FDA is to conduct a single pivotal study to achieve approval in HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients who previously received at least two chemotherapeutic regimens in the metastatic setting. Additionally, there is the possibility of achieving an accelerated approval based on interim results. Polyphor is also conducting preclinical work to establish the potential for balixafortide in combination with other drugs and in other oncology indications. About Polyphor Polyphor is a clinical stage, Swiss biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of antibiotics and immuno-oncology compounds. It has discovered and is developing the OMPTA (Outer Membrane Protein Targeting Antibiotics). The OMPTA are potentially the first new class of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria to have reached phase III stage in the last 50 years. The company's lead OMPTA, murepavadin, (POL7080) is in Phase III development against Pseudomonas aeruginosa - recognized as a critical priority 1 pathogen by WHO; in addition, Polyphor is developing a pipeline of further preclinical antibiotics based on its OMPTA platform. In addition, Polyphor is developing an immuno-oncology candidate, balixafortide (POL6326), which is starting a Phase III trial in combination with eribulin in patients with advanced breast cancer, and exploring in parallel its potential for further combinations and indications.

The focus is on the one hand on the technology area ""Scanner"", in which all activities in connection with the scanner technology developed by Staramba itself (e.g. photogrammetry scanner 3D-INSTAGRAPH(R)) are concentrated, and on the other hand on the area ""Virtual Reality"", which so far has mainly been filled by the Virtual Reality project MATERIA.ONE. After appropriate preparation by the management, the Board of Directors today decided to restructure the Virtual Reality division so that the resources necessary for the establishment and development of this business area can be used efficiently and purposefully. In addition to the further, long-term development of the MATERIA.ONE project, in the near future the focus will be on an offer from the company to plan, develop and implement innovative projects in the field of virtual reality. The goal is to generate additional income with the company's existing know-how in the conception and development of virtual worlds and applications. These changes require an adjustment of the cost structure, including the personnel reductions outlined above. The managing director has been entrusted with the implementation of the reorganization of business activities and authorized to take appropriate measures.

The results overall confirm earlier reported interim data from this trial. L-MIND is designed to investigate the antibody tafasitamab (MOR208) in combination with lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL) who are ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Tafasitamab is an investigational humanized Fc-enhanced monoclonal antibody directed against CD19 and is currently in clinical development in blood cancer indications. The data reported today included 80 patients enrolled into the trial who had received tafasitamab and lenalidomide and had been followed-up as per protocol for at least one year. Efficacy results in this update are based on response rates assessed by an independent review committee for all 80 patients. The primary endpoint, defined as best objective response rate (ORR) compared to published data on the respective monotherapies, has been met. The ORR was 60% (48 out of 80 patients), and the complete response (CR) rate was 43% (34 out of 80 patients). The median progression free survival (mPFS) was 12.1 months with a median follow-up of 17.3 months. The medium duration of response (mDoR) was 21.7 months. These results provide overall confirmation of the strong L-MIND data previously published at ASH in December 2018. These data showed an ORR of 58% with a CR rate of 33%; the mPFS was 16.2 months; data was assessed by the investigators.

In the 2018 financial year, a turnover of EUR 11.3 million was achieved. This is EUR 1.8 million higher than forecast in the ad hoc announcement on December 3, 2018. Due to the recent recommendation of the ""IFRS Interpretations Committee"" to disclose cryptocurrencies in fixed assets instead of current assets and thus to disclose changes in value not only in equity but also through write-ups/write-downs in the income statement, the Company has decided to change the statement in the ad hoc announcement of December 3, 2018 that profit before tax is expected to exceed EUR 7 million to the effect that profit before tax is now expected to be EUR 2.4 million. The change results from a write-down of EUR 6.1 million on the cryptocurrencies held by the Company as of December 31, 2018, in accordance with the latest IFRS recommendations. Without the application of this accounting recommendation, the profit before tax would have been EUR 8.6 million and, at EUR 1.6 million, significantly higher than the forecast of EUR 7 million of December 3, 2018. Provided that the current exchange rates on the crypto market, which are significantly higher than those on December 31, 2018, remain stable or continue to rise, this would result in a significantly profit-increasing write-up as of June 30, 2019, and would also increase equity accordingly. Although the management believes that the IFRS recommendation does not make sense for the company and that changes in the value of cryptocurrency holdings, as in previous years, should only be shown in equity and not in the income statement, the company will apply the recommendations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee for the 2018 annual financial statements and future annual financial statements. The amortization has no effect on the profit from ordinary activities before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which remains very positive at EUR 8.6 million. This also results from the fact that before the recommendation of the IFRS Interpretations Committee, EBT (earnings before taxes) almost corresponded to EBITDA and differed only relatively slightly from EBITDA by TEUR 18 in 2017 and by TEUR 17 in 2016. Since the cryptocurrencies held by the Company are still held only to hedge potential financial losses and not for speculative reasons, the Company will in future communicate EBITDA, which has been used as an internal indicator for years, to the capital market as the most important variable, as this best describes the Company's development from the Company's point of view.​ Contact: Bitcoin Group SE Marco Bodewein D-Nordstrasse 14 32051 Herford mail: ir2019@bitcoingroup.com phone: +49.5221.69435.20 fax: +49.5221.69435.25 website: www.bitcoingroup.com Investor Relations contact: CROSS ALLIANCE communication GmbH Susan Hoffmeister phone.: +49.89.1250903.30 mail: sh@crossalliance.com website: www.crossalliance.com Bitcoin Group SE publishes preliminary figures for the 2018 financial year Herford, May 17, 2019 - Bitcoin Group SE (ISIN DE000A1TNV91) discussed and evaluated the present preliminary IFRS consolidated financial statements for the year 2018 at today's meeting of the Board of Directors.

9622,Orascom Development Holding AG,Schweiz,"Orascom Development Holding AG: Back to green with net profit of CHF 1.0 million in Q1 2019, backed by financial and operational excellence across all segments and destinations. ",CH0038285679,1149025,"ODH (""Orascom Development Holding"") (SIX ODHN.SW) has released its consolidated financial results for Q1 2019. Orascom Development Holding: Back to green with net profit of CHF 1.0 million in Q1 2019, backed by financial and operational excellence across all segments and destinations. Highlights ODH reports first profitable quarter since 2015. Total revenues increased by 32.4% to CHF 98.1 million. Adj. EBITDA rose 40.1% to CHF 20.6 million in Q1 2019 with a solid operational margin of 21.0%. Cashflow from operations recorded a 24.6% increase to CHF 7.6 million. Net Real Estate sales went up 166.1% to CHF 105.9 million with sales increase in all destinations. Altdorf, 13 May 2019 - Orascom Development Holding AG started the year on solid grounds and generated positive operational results with a 32.4% increase in revenue to CHF 98.1 million compared to CHF 74.1 million in Q1 2018. All business segments contributed to the positive operational performance, solidifying the Group's message of being back on track. Gross profit increased by 37.4% to reach CHF 30.1 million (Q1 2018: CHF 21.9 million). The Adjusted EBITDA continued to grow by 40.1% to CHF 20.6 million compared to CHF 14.7 million in Q1 2018. The significant increase in the Adjusted EBITDA signals the improved operational performance across all business segments. The Hotels segment continued to show double digit growth compared to the same period of last year. The Real Estate segment continued its operational and financial performance across all destinations, while the Destination Management segment continued to grow as a result of the successful implementation of the restructuring started in 2018 in combination with the increase of events and activities across all destinations throughout the first quarter. Cashflow from operations increased by 24.6% to CHF 7.6 million (Q1 2018: CHF 6.1 million). Net debt was slightly reduced and reached CHF 244.9 million (Q1 2018: CHF 247.8 million). The enhanced operational performance across all segments was reflected in the bottom-line figures: The Group recorded a net profit of CHF 1.0 million in Q1 2019 compared to a net loss of CHF 5.1 million in Q1 2018. It is important to note that Q1 2018 figures included Tamweel Group, Royal and Club Azur Hotels that were disposed in Q4 2018. When figures of Q1 2018 are normalized for the revenues of the disposals, then Q1 2019 revenues would have increased by 47.1% vs. CHF 66.7 million in Q1 2018; and net income would have reached CHF 1.0 million vs. a net loss of CHF 7.5 million in Q1 2018. ""We are very pleased to see that ODH is performing strongly on its strategy and continues to deliver solid results which are positively hitting bottom line this quarter"", states CEO Khaled Bichara. Group Hotels: double digit growth in KPIs In Q1 2019, the Hotels segment continued to show double digit growth compared to the same period of last year. A 14.9% increase in revenue was achieved, from CHF 40.2 million in Q1 2018 to CHF 46.2 million in Q1 2019, which resulted in an increase of 24% in GOP to CHF 20.6 million (Q1 2018: CHF 16.6 million). GOP PAR jumped from CHF 33 to CHF 39 in Q1 2019 due to further improvements in operational efficiency. The Hotel segment reported a 14.7% increase in the Adj. EBITDA to CHF 17.9 million (Q1 2018: CHF 15.6 million). Group Real Estate: Solid operational and financial performance across all destinations The Real Estate segment continued its operational and financial performance across all destinations. Net real estate sales increased by 166.1% to CHF 105.9 million in Q1 2019 (Q1 2018: CHF 39.8 million). Growth in sales was driven by the increase in unit sales in the newly launched first home market project ""O West"" as well as El Gouna, Makadi Heights, Hawana Salalah and Luštica Bay. 407 units were contracted representing a growth of 166% compared to the number of sold units in Q1 2018. Revenues increased by 86.1% to CHF 41.5 million (Q1 2018: CHF 22.3 million), on the back of increased deliveries in El Gouna, Hawana Salalah and Jebal Sifah in addition to the recognized land portion for the sold units in O West. Total deferred revenue from real estate that is yet to be recognized until 2021 reached CHF 277.6 million and total real estate portfolio receivable increased by 76% to CHF 375 million. Group Destination Management: Continued growth thanks to successful restructuring The Destination Management segment continued to grow as a result of the successful implementation of the restructuring started in 2018, in combination with the increase of events and activities across all destinations throughout the first quarter. Revenues increased by 40.5% to CHF 10.4 million in Q1 2019 compared to CHF 7.4 million in Q1 2018, signaling growth and additional contributions from all destinations. Outlook 2019 For the full year 2019, ODH is targeting topline revenues of CHF 400 million and an Adjusted EBITDA within the range of CHF 74 million to CHF 77 million. These estimates exclude the contribution of Citadel Azur, Royal Azur, Club Azur hotels and Tamweel Group that the Group has identified as non-core assets and disposed in 2018. Thus, when FY 2018 figures are normalized for those assets, the targeted 2019 revenues represent a 25% growth from CHF 319 million in FY 2018 and the Adj. EBITDA represents 19%-24% growth from CHF 62 million in FY 2018. The Group is also envisaging new real estate net sales of CHF 445 million to CHF 470 million compared to CHF 200.6 million in 2018, capitalizing on its first home project ""O West"" and building on the positive momentum of El Gouna and Makadi Heights, Jebal Sifah, Hawana Salalah and Luštica Bay. Given the fact, that the hotel, tourism and real estate business shows some seasonality on a quarterly basis and due to the different destinations of ODH's operations and the revenue recognition model of the real estate business, quarterly results may show different levels of profitability/losses over the year. Details on Destinations El Gouna, Red Sea El Gouna hotels continued its successful performance with revenue growth of 22.6%, to CHF 16.8 million in Q1 2019 (Q1 2018: CHF 13.6 million), accomplished by a 31.6% increase in TRevPAR to CHF 75 in Q1 2019 compared to CHF 57 in Q1 2018. The ARR's continued its upward trend with an increase of 28.6% reaching CHF 63, (2018: CHF 49). Reported GOP increased by 20%, from CHF 7.0 million in Q1 2018 to CHF 8.4 million in Q1 2019. ODH finalized the renovation of three hotels and is progressing with another two hotels to be finalized in Q2 2019, while the renovation of Cook's Club Hotel (144 rooms) is expected to be finalized in August 2019. Furthermore, the Group is progressing with the construction of the new 100 rooms' hotel Casa Cook, to be opened in October 2019. Net real estate sales continued its positive momentum, capitalizing on the great demand from the launched projects ""Cyan"" and ""Ancient Sands Villas"". In Q1 2019, new inventory with a total value of USD 51.0 million was added in both projects. The launch phase included apartments and town houses. Net real estate sales increased by 15.5% to CHF 24.6 million vs. CHF 21.3 million in Q1 2018. It is worth mentioning that 20% of the sold units were sold to foreign clients signaling a good indication that the interest from foreigners is slowly coming back. Real estate revenues increased by 26.4% in Q1 2019 to reach CHF 16.3 million. Destination Management revenues rose by 37.1% to CHF 8.5 million (Q1 2018: CHF 6.2 million). In April 2019 ODH successfully hosted El Gouna International Open Squash Championship 2019 and El Gouna Polo 2019. First home market: O West, Egypt In Q1 2019, total contracted real estate sales reached CHF 53.0 million. As of today, the total contracted sales reached CHF 120.6 million and total reservations reached 74.7 million. We launched two phases, the first phase mainly included villas and the second phase included different range of apartments. Capitalizing on the huge demand and success, more inventory was added in April 2019 with a total value of CHF 40.0 million. To date, ODH managed to sell approximately 85% of the launched inventory. It is worth mentioning that in 2019, only the land portion of the villas that were sold will be recognized as revenues, yet no positive margins will be reflected due to the upfront marketing and sales expenses that will be paid out this year. Revenues and positive margins will start to kick in starting the year 2020 onwards. The huge success for O West which has been reflected in its sales figures, strongly reaffirms ODH's position as the market leader in building fully integrated towns and proves the company's success in penetrating the first home market in Egypt. Hawana Salalah, Oman In Hawana Salalah, net real estate sales increased by 56.5% to CHF 9.7 million compared to CHF 6.2 million in Q1 2018. The increase was mainly driven by the successful launch and sales of the ""Forest Island"" project, launched last year. It is also planned to launch a new real estate project with a total inventory of CHF 40.0 million in Q3 2019, capitalizing on the increasing demand for real estate offering in Salalah. Real Estate revenues reached CHF 8.6 million in Q1 2019. The hotels in Salalah continued their operational excellence since the beginning of the year. With the completion of additional 177 rooms in Al Fanar Hotel, Oman accounted for 38% of the total segment revenue in Q1 2019. The company strategy, aimed at further diversifying markets, supported a growth in revenues by 29.8% to reach CHF 17.0 million in Q1 2019, up from CHF 13.1 million in Q1 2018. Occupancy rates reached 96% during Q1 2019. The hotels GOP increased 43.3% to CHF 8.6 million (Q1 2018: CHF 6.0 million). GOPPAR increased significantly from CHF 74 to CHF 89 based on a further improvement in ARR of 13.9% to CHF 123 in Q1 2019. Total revenues from Hawana Salalah increased by 95.5% to reach CHF 26.0 million compared to CHF 13.3 million in Q1 2018. Luštica Bay, Montenegro With the increased interest on Luštica Bay paired with the opening of the destination's first hotel, the marina and the retail outlets, net real estate sales increased by 25.6% to CHF 4.9 million vs. CHF 3.9 million in Q1 2018. Construction is still underway on the final Magnolija and Kamelija buildings, as well the exclusive townhouses and stand-alone villas. In addition to that, the construction of Luštica Bay's town centre, Centrale began. On the Destination Management side, we opened the first phase of the main marina with 50 berths - the first marina to be built in Montenegro in the recent period. Following this, the remaining phase of the marina will be equipped, set to offer 176 berths in total. Jebel Sifah, Oman The 67 rooms boutique hotel started successfully into the new year, whereby revenues increased by 9.2% to CHF 0.8 million vs. CHF 0.7 million in Q1 2018; while GOP also increased by 38.9% to CHF 0.25mn vs. CHF 0.18mn in Q1 2018. Occupancy rates increased by 22.4% to reach 60% in Q1 2019 compared to 49% in Q1 2018.

Orascom Development Holding: Back to green with net profit of CHF 1.0 million in Q1 2019, backed by financial and operational excellence across all segments and destinations. Highlights ODH reports first profitable quarter since 2015. Total revenues increased by 32.4% to CHF 98.1 million. Adj. EBITDA rose 40.1% to CHF 20.6 million in Q1 2019 with a solid operational margin of 21.0%. Cashflow from operations recorded a 24.6% increase to CHF 7.6 million. Net Real Estate sales went up 166.1% to CHF 105.9 million with sales increase in all destinations. Altdorf, 13 May 2019 - Orascom Development Holding AG started the year on solid grounds and generated positive operational results with a 32.4% increase in revenue to CHF 98.1 million compared to CHF 74.1 million in Q1 2018. All business segments contributed to the positive operational performance, solidifying the Group's message of being back on track. Gross profit increased by 37.4% to reach CHF 30.1 million (Q1 2018: CHF 21.9 million). The Adjusted EBITDA continued to grow by 40.1% to CHF 20.6 million compared to CHF 14.7 million in Q1 2018. The significant increase in the Adjusted EBITDA signals the improved operational performance across all business segments. The Hotels segment continued to show double digit growth compared to the same period of last year. The Real Estate segment continued its operational and financial performance across all destinations, while the Destination Management segment continued to grow as a result of the successful implementation of the restructuring started in 2018 in combination with the increase of events and activities across all destinations throughout the first quarter. Cashflow from operations increased by 24.6% to CHF 7.6 million (Q1 2018: CHF 6.1 million). Net debt was slightly reduced and reached CHF 244.9 million (Q1 2018: CHF 247.8 million). The enhanced operational performance across all segments was reflected in the bottom-line figures: The Group recorded a net profit of CHF 1.0 million in Q1 2019 compared to a net loss of CHF 5.1 million in Q1 2018. It is important to note that Q1 2018 figures included Tamweel Group, Royal and Club Azur Hotels that were disposed in Q4 2018. When figures of Q1 2018 are normalized for the revenues of the disposals, then Q1 2019 revenues would have increased by 47.1% vs. CHF 66.7 million in Q1 2018; and net income would have reached CHF 1.0 million vs. a net loss of CHF 7.5 million in Q1 2018. ""We are very pleased to see that ODH is performing strongly on its strategy and continues to deliver solid results which are positively hitting bottom line this quarter"", states CEO Khaled Bichara. Group Hotels: double digit growth in KPIs In Q1 2019, the Hotels segment continued to show double digit growth compared to the same period of last year. A 14.9% increase in revenue was achieved, from CHF 40.2 million in Q1 2018 to CHF 46.2 million in Q1 2019, which resulted in an increase of 24% in GOP to CHF 20.6 million (Q1 2018: CHF 16.6 million). GOP PAR jumped from CHF 33 to CHF 39 in Q1 2019 due to further improvements in operational efficiency. The Hotel segment reported a 14.7% increase in the Adj. EBITDA to CHF 17.9 million (Q1 2018: CHF 15.6 million). Group Real Estate: Solid operational and financial performance across all destinations The Real Estate segment continued its operational and financial performance across all destinations. Net real estate sales increased by 166.1% to CHF 105.9 million in Q1 2019 (Q1 2018: CHF 39.8 million). Growth in sales was driven by the increase in unit sales in the newly launched first home market project ""O West"" as well as El Gouna, Makadi Heights, Hawana Salalah and Luštica Bay. 407 units were contracted representing a growth of 166% compared to the number of sold units in Q1 2018. Revenues increased by 86.1% to CHF 41.5 million (Q1 2018: CHF 22.3 million), on the back of increased deliveries in El Gouna, Hawana Salalah and Jebal Sifah in addition to the recognized land portion for the sold units in O West. Total deferred revenue from real estate that is yet to be recognized until 2021 reached CHF 277.6 million and total real estate portfolio receivable increased by 76% to CHF 375 million. Group Destination Management: Continued growth thanks to successful restructuring The Destination Management segment continued to grow as a result of the successful implementation of the restructuring started in 2018, in combination with the increase of events and activities across all destinations throughout the first quarter. Revenues increased by 40.5% to CHF 10.4 million in Q1 2019 compared to CHF 7.4 million in Q1 2018, signaling growth and additional contributions from all destinations. Outlook 2019 For the full year 2019, ODH is targeting topline revenues of CHF 400 million and an Adjusted EBITDA within the range of CHF 74 million to CHF 77 million. These estimates exclude the contribution of Citadel Azur, Royal Azur, Club Azur hotels and Tamweel Group that the Group has identified as non-core assets and disposed in 2018. Thus, when FY 2018 figures are normalized for those assets, the targeted 2019 revenues represent a 25% growth from CHF 319 million in FY 2018 and the Adj. EBITDA represents 19%-24% growth from CHF 62 million in FY 2018. The Group is also envisaging new real estate net sales of CHF 445 million to CHF 470 million compared to CHF 200.6 million in 2018, capitalizing on its first home project ""O West"" and building on the positive momentum of El Gouna and Makadi Heights, Jebal Sifah, Hawana Salalah and Luštica Bay. Given the fact, that the hotel, tourism and real estate business shows some seasonality on a quarterly basis and due to the different destinations of ODH's operations and the revenue recognition model of the real estate business, quarterly results may show different levels of profitability/losses over the year. Details on Destinations El Gouna, Red Sea El Gouna hotels continued its successful performance with revenue growth of 22.6%, to CHF 16.8 million in Q1 2019 (Q1 2018: CHF 13.6 million), accomplished by a 31.6% increase in TRevPAR to CHF 75 in Q1 2019 compared to CHF 57 in Q1 2018. The ARR's continued its upward trend with an increase of 28.6% reaching CHF 63, (2018: CHF 49). Reported GOP increased by 20%, from CHF 7.0 million in Q1 2018 to CHF 8.4 million in Q1 2019. ODH finalized the renovation of three hotels and is progressing with another two hotels to be finalized in Q2 2019, while the renovation of Cook's Club Hotel (144 rooms) is expected to be finalized in August 2019. Furthermore, the Group is progressing with the construction of the new 100 rooms' hotel Casa Cook, to be opened in October 2019. Net real estate sales continued its positive momentum, capitalizing on the great demand from the launched projects ""Cyan"" and ""Ancient Sands Villas"". In Q1 2019, new inventory with a total value of USD 51.0 million was added in both projects. The launch phase included apartments and town houses. Net real estate sales increased by 15.5% to CHF 24.6 million vs. CHF 21.3 million in Q1 2018. It is worth mentioning that 20% of the sold units were sold to foreign clients signaling a good indication that the interest from foreigners is slowly coming back. Real estate revenues increased by 26.4% in Q1 2019 to reach CHF 16.3 million. Destination Management revenues rose by 37.1% to CHF 8.5 million (Q1 2018: CHF 6.2 million). In April 2019 ODH successfully hosted El Gouna International Open Squash Championship 2019 and El Gouna Polo 2019. First home market: O West, Egypt In Q1 2019, total contracted real estate sales reached CHF 53.0 million. As of today, the total contracted sales reached CHF 120.6 million and total reservations reached 74.7 million. We launched two phases, the first phase mainly included villas and the second phase included different range of apartments. Capitalizing on the huge demand and success, more inventory was added in April 2019 with a total value of CHF 40.0 million. To date, ODH managed to sell approximately 85% of the launched inventory. It is worth mentioning that in 2019, only the land portion of the villas that were sold will be recognized as revenues, yet no positive margins will be reflected due to the upfront marketing and sales expenses that will be paid out this year. Revenues and positive margins will start to kick in starting the year 2020 onwards. The huge success for O West which has been reflected in its sales figures, strongly reaffirms ODH's position as the market leader in building fully integrated towns and proves the company's success in penetrating the first home market in Egypt. Hawana Salalah, Oman In Hawana Salalah, net real estate sales increased by 56.5% to CHF 9.7 million compared to CHF 6.2 million in Q1 2018. The increase was mainly driven by the successful launch and sales of the ""Forest Island"" project, launched last year. It is also planned to launch a new real estate project with a total inventory of CHF 40.0 million in Q3 2019, capitalizing on the increasing demand for real estate offering in Salalah. Real Estate revenues reached CHF 8.6 million in Q1 2019. The hotels in Salalah continued their operational excellence since the beginning of the year. With the completion of additional 177 rooms in Al Fanar Hotel, Oman accounted for 38% of the total segment revenue in Q1 2019. The company strategy, aimed at further diversifying markets, supported a growth in revenues by 29.8% to reach CHF 17.0 million in Q1 2019, up from CHF 13.1 million in Q1 2018. Occupancy rates reached 96% during Q1 2019. The hotels GOP increased 43.3% to CHF 8.6 million (Q1 2018: CHF 6.0 million). GOPPAR increased significantly from CHF 74 to CHF 89 based on a further improvement in ARR of 13.9% to CHF 123 in Q1 2019. Total revenues from Hawana Salalah increased by 95.5% to reach CHF 26.0 million compared to CHF 13.3 million in Q1 2018. Luštica Bay, Montenegro With the increased interest on Luštica Bay paired with the opening of the destination's first hotel, the marina and the retail outlets, net real estate sales increased by 25.6% to CHF 4.9 million vs. CHF 3.9 million in Q1 2018. Construction is still underway on the final Magnolija and Kamelija buildings, as well the exclusive townhouses and stand-alone villas. In addition to that, the construction of Luštica Bay's town centre, Centrale began. On the Destination Management side, we opened the first phase of the main marina with 50 berths - the first marina to be built in Montenegro in the recent period. Following this, the remaining phase of the marina will be equipped, set to offer 176 berths in total.

385,Leoni AG,Germany,Leoni AG: First-quarter business figures: Leoni burdened by one-time effects - tangible improvement in EBIT and free cash flow in the course of the year expected ,DE0005408884,1149859,"First-quarter business figures: Leoni burdened by one-time effects - tangible improvement in EBIT and free cash flow in the course of the year expected Nuremberg, 14 May 2019 - Leoni AG of Nuremberg (ISIN DE 0005408884 / WKN 540888) had to absorb exceptional items that weighed on the Group result by a non-recurring, total amount of EUR 102 million. Against the backdrop of the changed economic conditions, the weaker market for the automotive industry and its realignment towards strategic customer relationships as part of its VALUE 21 programme, Leoni has reassessed the WSD order book and its market prospects. This reassessment led to non-cash write-downs in the first quarter of tangible and intangible assets by EUR 67 million as well as to provisions of EUR 35 million primarily for losses expected on existing orders in the future, which could become cash relevant over a period of several years. Furthermore, there were increased personnel and freight costs related to the project ramp-up at the new production facility in Merida, Mexico, at the start of the year. As a result, earnings were negatively impacted by EUR 37 million in the first quarter. Leoni expects a further negative EBIT-impact of approximately EUR 20 million largely to be booked in Q2 2019. Adjusted for the non-recurring items and the charges incurred in Merida, Leoni's Group-wide EBIT stabilised compared with the 4th quarter of 2018 - in operating terms - to a figure of EUR 14 million. Reported EBIT for the first quarter was a loss of EUR 125 million (Q1/2018: earnings of EUR 63 million). EBITDA amounted to a loss of EUR 76 million (Q1/2018: EUR 101 million) and sales amounted to EUR 1.262 billion (Q1/2018: EUR 1.327 billion). As reported, the Group result was a loss of EUR 132 million, compared to a profit of EUR 44 million in the previous year. Investment in property, plant and equipment as well as intangible assets amounted to EUR 78 million in the period from January to March 2019 (Q1/2018: EUR 57 million). Primarily this pertained to the Wiring Systems Division in order to provide capacity in Eastern Europe, North Africa and Central America for projects already booked in the preceding years. Free cash flow amounted to negative EUR 313 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019 (Q1/2018: negative EUR 111 million). In addition to capital expenditures, free cash flow was primarily affected by the negative result for the reported period as well as reversals in net working capital. Leoni expects to have reached the inflection point in terms of EBIT and cash usage and compared with the first quarter will tangibly improve earnings and, in particular, free cash flow throughout the course of the year. It is further intended, before VALUE 21 related effects, to achieve a neutral free cash flow in the Group in the coming financial year as well as a positive contribution to the Group result from the Wiring Systems Division, On 31 March 2019, the Company had available liquidity of EUR 740 million (31/12/2018: EUR 1 billion), of which about EUR 620 million in unused credit lines, more than three quarters of which firmly committed, and EUR 120 million in cash and cash equivalents. Particularly with respect to Leoni's refinancing requirements, the Company is considering all options for ensuring its long-term financing basis. Due to the quarterly loss and an accounting-related enlargement of the balance sheet by approx. EUR 153 million, the equity ratio was 25.2 percent compared with 31.2 percent at the end of 2018. The Wiring Systems Division's EBIT declined to a loss of EUR 139 million (Q1/2018: earnings of EUR 42 million). Excluding the one-off effects and exceptional items from Merida, the Wiring Systems Division's result was balanced. The segment's sales were down by 6 percent to EUR 793 million (Q1/2018: EUR 842 million), caused by the weaker demand for the automotive industry in China and Europe. In the Wire & Cable Solutions Division (WCS), sales dipped by 4 percent year on year to EUR 469 million in the first quarter of 2019 (Q1/2018: EUR 486 million). Above all, this reflected the weaker automotive cables business in China because of the slowing economy as well as the lower price of copper. Due to the sales decrease, the unfavourable product mix and costs related to expanding its digitalization portfolio, the division's EBIT declined to EUR 14 million (Q1/2018: EUR 22 million). *** This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements that are based on the current assumptions and forecasts of Leoni AG's management.

The European Commission took the improvements of the submitted covenants proposed by thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel as an opportunity to conduct another market test. The new market survey did not resolve the Commission's concerns, although the partners had offered significant further concessions. From the point of the view of thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel, further commitments or improvements would adversely affect the intended synergies of the merger to such an extent that the economic logic of the joint venture would no longer be valid. Consequently, the partners assume that the European Commission will not approve the joint venture. With the expected unsuccessful outcome of the steel joint venture, the Executive Board of thyssenkrupp AG has reassessed the strategic options for the company and will propose to the Supervisory Board to not go ahead with the planned separation into two independent companies. The economic downturn and its effects on business development and the current capital market environment have led to the separation not being able to be realized as planned. Instead, thyssenkrupp will fundamentally realign itself to significantly improve its operating performance. This will include a value based more flexible portfolio approach with greater freedom for the development of all businesses, a leaner holding structure and a stronger performance orientation. At the same time, the company will sustainably strengthen its capital base in order to gain the necessary financial leeway for necessary restructuring and business development. As part of this new strategy, the Executive Board of thyssenkrupp AG will also propose an IPO of Elevator Technology to the Supervisory Board. Due to this development, expected book equity gains from the closing of the Steel Joint Venture will not materialize. In the third quarter of the current fiscal year, thyssenkrupp will reintegrate the Steel Europe Business Area back into the Group. This will also lead to an adjustment of the forecast for the 2018/19 financial year. From today's perspective, the Group expects - including the Steel Division - an adjusted EBIT of EUR1.1 to 1.2 billion. The Group's free cash flow before M&A is expected to be negative in the high 3-digit million EUR range. The Group expects a net loss for the year. thyssenkrupp will publish the adjusted Group forecast with the 2nd quarter report on May 14, 2019. thyssenkrupp Steel Europe AG is, among other companies, the subject of preliminary investigations into alleged cartel agreements for heavy plate and flat carbon steel. The proceedings in the field of flat carbon steel have been discontinued in the meantime. Due to far-advanced discussions with the Federal Cartel Office, thyssenkrupp expects to be able to finalize the proceedings for heavy plate in a timely manner by mutual agreement. In this forecast, the Group will also recognize an increase of the existing provisions by slightly more than EUR 100 million for the ongoing cartel proceedings regarding heavy plate. The provision is thus increased to the amount of the expected fine. The Group's free cash flow could be additionally impacted by a payment of this fine in this financial year.

The kidney alteration incidences were observed in 56% of the patients treated in the PRISM-MDR study. According to literature and the comparator arm, an estimated incidence of 25-40% was expected. The decision has been taken consensually with the independent Data Monitoring Committee. An update on the continuation of both Phase III studies will be provided in July once all data will be available and reviewed. ""While pro-actively halting the Phase III trials for murepavadin is disappointing, patient safety is of utmost importance to Polyphor,"" said Frank Weber, Polyphor Director and Chief Medical and Development Officer a.i. ""We are trying to better understand the reasons for these events and exploring ideas on how to tackle them for the future, as we remain convinced that murepavadin could still represent a valuable drug to help patients fighting pseudomonas infections."" The decision to temporarily halt enrollment applies only to the PRISM-MDR and PRISM-UDR studies and does neither impact the further development of the murepavadin inhaled program, nor the advancement of the OMPTA program, nor the development of the immuno-oncology candidate, balixafortide (POL6326), which is starting a Phase III trial in combination with eribulin in patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer. Polyphor will host a conference call at 08.00 CET on Friday, May 10, 2019.

The study will compare murepavadin combined with one other anti-pseudomonal antibiotic against two other anti-pseudomonal antibiotics. The study was designed based on feedback from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is agreed as the basis for a potential approval in the EU. The primary efficacy objective of the study is to assess the clinical cure rate at TOC in the mITT population. Eligible subjects with a high probability of VABP due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio. The miTT population shall comprise 120 evaluable subjects (80 in the treatment arm) with VABP confirmed to be due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. About the PRISM-UDR study PRISM-UDR is a global Phase III multicenter, sponsor blinded, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, non-inferiority study of murepavadin combined with ertapenem in adult patients with nosocomial pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The primary efficacy objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority (20% non-inferiority margin) of murepavadin compared to an anti-pseudomonal β-lactam-based antibiotic. The study was designed based on feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is agreed as the basis for a potential approval in the US. Eligible subjects with a high probability of nosocomial pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa will be allocated at random to receive murepavadin or a comparator beta-lactam agent in a 1:1 ratio. The primary analysis population will comprise 210 subjects (105 subjects per arm) with nosocomial pneumonia confirmed to be due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. About Murepavadin (POL7080) Murepavadin is Polyphor's most advanced product candidate and the first OMPTA in clinical development. It is being developed for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia (including both hospital-acquired (HABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP)) due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and has been granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and fast track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of VABP due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Murepavadin is a pathogen specific antibiotic functioning through a novel mechanism of action involving binding to an outer membrane protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In contrast to commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics, murepavadin is a precision medicine and as such it supports the growing practice known as ""antibiotic stewardship"" which, among other things, seeks to reduce the excessive use of broad-spectrum products to avoid the buildup of resistance and to preserve the microbiome of the patients. Based on promising Phase II results, Polyphor has agreed on a streamlined development pathway for murepavadin with the FDA and EMA and has started its Phase III clinical program. About Polyphor Polyphor is a clinical stage, Swiss biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of antibiotics and immuno-oncology compounds. It has discovered and is developing the OMPTA (Outer Membrane Protein Targeting Antibiotics). The OMPTA are potentially the first new class of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria to have reached phase III stage in the last 50 years. The company's lead OMPTA, murepavadin, (POL7080) is in Phase III development against Pseudomonas aeruginosa - recognized as a critical priority 1 pathogen by WHO; in addition, Polyphor is developing a pipeline of further preclinical antibiotics based on its OMPTA platform. In addition, Polyphor is developing an immuno-oncology candidate, balixafortide (POL6326), which is starting a Phase III trial in combination with eribulin in patients with advanced breast cancer, and exploring in parallel its potential for further combinations and indications. Polyphor is based in Allschwil near Basel and is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX: POLN). For more information, please visit www.polyphor.com.

The study will compare murepavadin combined with one other anti-pseudomonal antibiotic against two other anti-pseudomonal antibiotics. The study was designed based on feedback from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is agreed as the basis for a potential approval in the EU. The primary efficacy objective of the study is to assess the clinical cure rate at TOC in the mITT population. Eligible subjects with a high probability of VABP due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio. The miTT population shall comprise 120 evaluable subjects (80 in the treatment arm) with VABP confirmed to be due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. About the PRISM-UDR study PRISM-UDR is a global Phase III multicenter, sponsor blinded, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, non-inferiority study of murepavadin combined with ertapenem in adult patients with nosocomial pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The primary efficacy objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority (20% non-inferiority margin) of murepavadin compared to an anti-pseudomonal β-lactam-based antibiotic. The study was designed based on feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is agreed as the basis for a potential approval in the US. Eligible subjects with a high probability of nosocomial pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa will be allocated at random to receive murepavadin or a comparator beta-lactam agent in a 1:1 ratio. The primary analysis population will comprise 210 subjects (105 subjects per arm) with nosocomial pneumonia confirmed to be due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. About Murepavadin (POL7080) Murepavadin is Polyphor's most advanced product candidate and the first OMPTA in clinical development. It is being developed for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia (including both hospital-acquired (HABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP)) due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and has been granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and fast track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of VABP due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Murepavadin is a pathogen specific antibiotic functioning through a novel mechanism of action involving binding to an outer membrane protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In contrast to commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics, murepavadin is a precision medicine and as such it supports the growing practice known as ""antibiotic stewardship"" which, among other things, seeks to reduce the excessive use of broad-spectrum products to avoid the buildup of resistance and to preserve the microbiome of the patients. Based on promising Phase II results, Polyphor has agreed on a streamlined development pathway for murepavadin with the FDA and EMA and has started its Phase III clinical program. About Polyphor Polyphor is a clinical stage, Swiss biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of antibiotics and immuno-oncology compounds. It has discovered and is developing the OMPTA (Outer Membrane Protein Targeting Antibiotics). The OMPTA are potentially the first new class of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria to have reached phase III stage in the last 50 years. The company's lead OMPTA, murepavadin, (POL7080) is in Phase III development against Pseudomonas aeruginosa - recognized as a critical priority 1 pathogen by WHO; in addition, Polyphor is developing a pipeline of further preclinical antibiotics based on its OMPTA platform. In addition, Polyphor is developing an immuno-oncology candidate, balixafortide (POL6326), which is starting a Phase III trial in combination with eribulin in patients with advanced breast cancer, and exploring in parallel its potential for further combinations and indications. Polyphor is based in Allschwil near Basel and is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX: POLN). For more information, please visit www.polyphor.com.

359686,Leclanché SA,Schweiz,Leclanché concludes its Annual General Meeting ,CH0110303119,1148653,"Leclanché concludes its Annual General Meeting Significant debt to equity conversion strengthens the balance sheet EBITDA loss trend reversed and revenues at a 22-year high in 2018 Major projects in operation in the Stationary Solutions business and solid pipeline of orders in the e-Transport business provide critical scale and put the Company on track towards profitability Bénédict Fontanet and Lluís Fargas join the Board of Directors YVERDON LES BAINS, Switzerland, May 9, 2019: Leclanché SA (SIX: LECN), one of the world's leading energy storage solutions companies, today announced that the Company's shareholders approved all but one of the proposals of the Board of Directors at its 2019 Annual General Meeting (EGM) held today in Yverdon-les-Bains. The debt to equity conversion of CHF 36 million of debt contracted with FEFAM[1], the Company's main shareholder, was approved by shareholders. This restructuring measure shall reduce the Company's debt level to CHF 10.5 million. The strengthened balance sheet shall drive increased investment interest in the Company at this time of strong growth in Leclanché's order book in the fast-growing e-Transport sector. The Board regrets that the resolution to reduce the nominal value of the shares from CHF 1.50 to CHF 0.10 was not approved by the majority of shareholders. The Board will review the options to restructure the balance sheet as a matter of priority. The Board is pleased to announce that Bénédict FONTANET and Lluís M. FARGAS have been elected to the Board of Directors. Mr. Fontanet is the chairman of the board of directors of Golden Partner SA in Geneva - an investment advisor to FEFAM, the Company's main shareholder - and was introduced to the Board of Directors by Golden Partner. A former President of the Geneva Christian Democratic Party and former Member of the Grand Council, Mr. Fontanet is a lawyer and director of several companies and brings his vast experience to Leclanché. Mr. Fargas joined Alcoa Inc. in 1994, after five years spent as Senior Manager at Coopers & Lybrand in Barcelona, Spain. Since November 2016, Mr. Fargas has held the role of Vice President Tax, Controller and Corporate Development Europe at Arconic, which retained the rolling, plating, precision casting and fastening operations of Alcoa Inc. Mr. Fargas manages the European Tax and Country Controllership function, and is responsible for running the corporate development strategy of Arconic in Europe. Mr. Fargas is a visiting Professor at the University of Lausanne - UNIL Switzerland, and he frequently lectures at international seminars and workshops. Mr. Fargas will bring his vast finance, tax and merger & acquisition experience to Leclanché, as well as his strong network across the aerospace, automotive and banking industries. Commercial breakthroughs In his address to shareholders, Anil Srivastava, CEO of Leclanché, outlined the progress made by the Company since implementing the Growth Plan announced in 2015. In 2018, Leclanché recorded its highest revenues in 22 years, almost tripling its turnover to CHF 48.7 million. Commercial breakthroughs have allowed Leclanché to enter the Indian market via the establishment of Nexcharge, a joint-venture with Exide Industries, India's leading acid battery producer, and to sign significant orders in the e-Marine business with world leading Maritime Systems Integrator, Kongsberg, which is based in Norway. With the constant and steady support of all shareholders, in particular FEFAM, its major shareholder who converted CHF 71 million into capital, Leclanché has been able to meet its growth targets while reversing the EBITDA loss trend. Stationary Solutions: in operation throughout the world With projects in operation in eight countries throughout the world, the Stationary Solutions business is solidly pivoted towards profitable integrated systems and software solutions for renewable energies. This month will see the inception of the Cremzow lithium-ion storage facility east of Berlin, Germany, with a 22 MW/34 MWh capacity, with leading European energy company Enel. In the EV Charging business, Leclanché has signed an agreement with EV Networks UK to supply charging stations in Britain. The first ten sites have been identified and pilot testing will start before year end. Finally, an agreement has been signed with a Caribbean national government for a large solar and storage project, with delivery to be completed in Q3 2020. e-Transport: firm order book of CHF 42 million In e-Transport (heavy duty, public transport vehicles and marine vessels), Leclanché is making history with its pioneering European partners as the world's first fully electrical-powered ferry is currently undergoing live tests before commercial operation begins next month. Moreover, Leclanché has accumulated a confirmed e-Marine order book valued at CHF 42 million for delivery in 2019-20. In a further strengthening of upcoming orders, modules for 35 e-Buses battery packs to Ashok Leyland in India, through a master supply agreement with Sun Mobility, have been delivered. Other planned projects, including pilot testing in California to power a hybrid e-Truck and systems integrator solution for a world leading electric train manufacturer, should steadily increase revenues in this trendsetting business. Towards critical scale and profit Looking ahead to 2020, a strong pipeline and recurring orders from the e-Transport business of more than 135 MWh or CHF 54 million and more than 90 MWh or CHF 45 million from the Stationary Solutions business, will ensure the Company's continued growth, bring Leclanché closer to critical scale and on track to profitability. On the costs side, thanks to the strong order book in the e-Transport business, the cell production facility will reach near-full capacity utilization by the end of 2019. This will reduce the scrap rate significantly, which will enable the Company to reach profitable production levels. Expected revenues should reach CHF 55 million to CHF 60 million, representing 13% to 23% annual growth. We will update our guidance in September as the final 2019 revenues depend on the delivery and implementation schedule of a key Solar PV + Storage project in the Caribbean, which is currently in final negotiations. Anil Srivastava, CEO of Leclanché, said: ""In 2018, Leclanché has turned the corner with a steady increase in revenue and firm orders that further strengthen the growth of the Company's business. Our continued success in e-Marine, and the Company's selection by world leading bus, truck and rail manufacturers, are a testament to Leclanché's strategy to focus its technology and products towards fleet vehicles and to be a leading contributor to a more efficient and greener energy world. I am grateful to our shareholders for their continued support and strong commitment to fulfilling this pioneering strategy.""

Fargas Mas is elected as a new independent member of the Board of Directors at the ordinary Annual General Meeting which will be held on 9 May 2019. Dr. Lluís M. Fargas (born in 1966) is a Swiss and Spanish national. In 2010, Dr. Fargas earned his Ph.D. in Finance and Tax Law from Universitat Rovira I Virgili (Spain) graduating summa cum laude. His thesis was based on the ""Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) and the Impact/Effect on European Member States' Tax Revenues."" He holds a Masters degree in law from the Instituto de Empresa (Madrid) and a law degree from the University of Barcelona. Dr. Fargas joined Alcoa Inc. in 1994, after five years spent as Senior Manager at Coopers & Lybrand, in Barcelona (Spain). Since November 2016 after the spin-off of Alcoa Inc. upstream and downstream businesses into two companies (Alcoa Corp. and Arconic Inc.), Dr. Fargas has been serving in the role of Vice President Tax, Controller and Corporate Development Europe at Arconic, which retained the rolling, plating, precision casting and fastening operations of Alcoa Inc. Dr. Fargas manages the European Tax and Country Controllership function, assuming also the responsibilities for running the corporate development strategy of Arconic in Europe - a $4 billion business with 40 manufacturing sites and over 10,000 employees - with the ultimate goal to leverage business opportunities and accelerate actions to strengthen all Arconic businesses' strategic position within the region. In addition to his function at Arconic, Dr. Fargas is a Visiting Professor at the University of Lausanne - UNIL (Switzerland). He also frequently provides lectures at international seminars and workshops. Mr. Stefan A. Müller, Chairman of the Board of Directors said: ""Mr. Fargas would bring to the Leclanché Board of Directors proven financial and corporate development skills as well as many years of professional experience in a multinational operating in a highly demanding environment. His in-depth knowledge of efficient financial and legal structures as well as his strong global network in the aerospace, automotive and banking industry, will give Leclanché access to invaluable insights which can serve the company's further development. We believe that Mr. Fargas' vast financial experience as well as his independent position makes him perfectly suited to contribute to the Company's current and future priorities in the most efficient and responsible way. The election of Mr. Fargas will ensure that Board control remains with Independent Directors."" In addition, the Board of Directors wishes to inform the Company's shareholders that for the same Independent Director position, Mr. Antoine Spillmann, as representative of Bruellan Corporate Governance Action Fund (a major shareholder of the Company), informed the Board of Directors about his intention to propose at the ordinary Annual General Meeting which will be held on 9 May 2019, the election of Mr. Jacques Boppe, 38 years old, to the Board of Directors. Mr. Boppe is a Swiss national currently working as an independent advisor on microgrid projects. Mr. Boppe has more than ten years of experience in the renewable energy sector.

The Board of Directors proposes a distribution of CHF 1.10 per share on 1 July 2019 and a conditional distribution of CHF 3.80 per share. This additional distribution is subject to the condition that the company has realised, by 30 September 2019 at the latest, the private placement of Infracore SA shares, resulting in the removal of this subsidiary from AEVIS VICTORIA's consolidation scope. This distribution of nearly CHF 60 million corresponds to approximately 20% of the capital gain realised by AEVIS VICTORIA on its participation. After the partial sale of Infracore SA, AEVIS VICTORIA will benefit from a highly capitalised balance sheet profile with low debt, and cash reserves allowing the company to consider new investments in its sectors of activity. The Board of Directors thus confirms its willingness to share the value created by the company with its shareholders. The Board of Directors therefore proposes a revised appropriation of retained earnings, including an allocation to the legal retained earnings CHF 15'635'207 (a legal allocation of 5% plus a voluntary allocation of CHF 13'609'207) and a balance brought forward of CHF 24'885'460. The shareholders will also decide on the split of one share with a nominal value of CHF 5 into five shares with a nominal value of CHF 1, thus targeting an improvement of the stock liquidity.

9828,Deutsche Rohstoff AG,Deutschland,Deutsche Rohstoff AG: Further dividend increase planned ,DE000A0XYG76,1147317,"Deutsche Rohstoff AG: Further dividend increase planned Full year 2018 financials and annual report online/Net profit of EUR 4.1 million in the first quarter of 2019 /Guidance for 2019/2020 published Mannheim. In fiscal year 2018, Deutsche Rohstoff Group generated sales of EUR 109,1 million (previous year: EUR 53.7 million), EBITDA of EUR 97.9 million (previous year: EUR 36.1 million) and consolidated net income of EUR 17.9 million (previous year: EUR 7.7 million; all figures German Gaap HGB and audited). The Executive Board and Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting to be held in Mannheim on 4 July 2019 that a further increased dividend of EUR 0.70 per share be distributed (previous year: EUR 0.65). Deutsche Rohstoff AG is thus expected to pay a rising dividend for the fifth consecutive year. Significant aspects of the 2018 financial year and the consolidated financial statements: Sales increased by more than 100%. Oil and gas production doubled year-on-year to 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (""BOE""), equivalent to production of around 9,600 BOE per day. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), on of the company's key performance indicator, increased more than 250% year-on-year. EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes) increased six-fold to EUR 32.7 million. Other operating income of EUR 19.1 million resulted primarily from the sale of the major assets of the subsidiary Salt Creek Oil & Gas in the amount of USD 60 million. In the USA, investments of around USD 110 million were made in new wells at Cub Creek and Elster Oil & Gas in late 2017 and early 2018. Operating cash flow (sales after operating costs, local taxes and royalties) of the two companies from all wells amounted to USD 103 million in 2018. The equity ratio rose from 26,5% to 32,8%. Depletion at the US subsidiaries Cub Creek and Elster was lower than expected during the year due to the reserve estimate as at 31 December 2018. For reasons of prudence, the Management Board nevertheless made an impairment of EUR 13.2 million at Cub Creek Energy. The financial result of EUR -13.4 million was significantly influenced by interest expenses of EUR 6.7 million and write-downs on securities in non-current and current assets of EUR 7.2 million. In particular, the devaluation of Northern Oil and Gas's shares to the price as of December 31, 2018 of EUR 2.26 per share had a significant effect with expenses of EUR 5.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents (bank balances and securities held as current assets) doubled year-on-year to EUR 60 million. In the course of the year, the company was able to place a convertible bond in the amount of EUR 10.7 million. The bond 2013/2018 with an interest rate of 8% was fully redeemed in July 2018. First quarter 2019 According to preliminary figures (HGB, unaudited), the Group generated sales of EUR 14.7 million, EBITDA of EUR 12.8 million and consolidated net income of EUR 4.1 million in the first quarter of 2019. Average production was around 6,300 BOE per day, total production 566,000 BOE . Oil accounted for 253,000 barrel of total BOE. The revaluation of Northern Oil & Gas shares to their price on March 31, 2019 had a significant positive effect of EUR 2.4 million. The complete quarterly figures will be published on 9 May. Forecast 2019 and 2020: For fiscal year 2019, the Management Board expects consolidated sales of EUR 40 to 50 million and EBITDA of EUR 25 to 35 million, and sales of EUR 75 to 85 million and EBITDA of EUR 55 to 65 million, respectively, for fiscal year 2020. For both years, the Executive Board anticipates a positive net profit for the group. The forecast is based on the assumption of an average oil price of 58 USD/barrel and an EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.14. For a definition of EBITDA, please refer to the homepage of Deutsche Rohstoff AG at https://rohstoff.de/en/apm/. The forecast for the year 2019 is based only on sales of the currently already producing wells, for 2020 additionally on the production of 11 more wells from the Olander drilling site. Possible further acquisitions are not included in the planning for either year. Drilling from the Olander drill site will commence in early June 2019 and production is expected to commence in early 2020. Thomas Gutschlag, CEO of Deutsche Rohstoff, commented: ""In 2018 we benefited from the very high investments in new wells at Cub Creek and Elster and from the almost simultaneous start of production of all new wells in the first quarter. Revenues, EBITDA and net profit more than doubled, even more than tenfold compared to 2016. Due to the high returns in 2018, the Group can rely on solid financial resources. We have also significantly reduced balance sheet risks by taking extensive write-downs on Cub Creek and the securities we hold. The start to the new year was positive, which is why we are confident for the year as a whole. Shareholders will again benefit this year from an increased dividend if the Annual General Meeting follows our proposal.""

In the USA, investments of around USD 110 million were made in new wells at Cub Creek and Elster Oil & Gas in late 2017 and early 2018. Operating cash flow (sales after operating costs, local taxes and royalties) of the two companies from all wells amounted to USD 103 million in 2018. The equity ratio rose from 26,5% to 32,8%.

Sales and earnings development in the first quarter of 2019 In the first quarter of 2019 (01 January 2019 to 31 March 2019) the Allgeier Group increased its total operating performance by 22 percent to EUR 189.7 million (continuing operations of the previous year: EUR 155.2 million). Adjusted Group EBITDA (EBITDA before effects that qualify as extraordinary or non-periodic) for the first three months of 2019 rose by 34 percent to EUR 14.0 million (previous year: EUR 10.5 million). EBITDA for the period amounted to EUR 13.4 million (previous year: EUR 9.5 million), corresponding to an increase of 41 percent. In the first quarter of 2019, the Group thus generated EBIT of EUR 5.8 million (previous year: EUR 4.1 million), which likewise corresponds to an increase of 41 percent compared with the same period of the previous year. In the first quarter of 2019, the standard for accounting for rental and lease agreements to be applied from 1 January 2019 onwards in accordance with IFRS was implemented (IFRS 16). This accounting change resulted in an increase in EBITDA of EUR 3.9 million in the first quarter of 2019; the prior-year quarter was up by EUR 2.9 million. The change in accounting for EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 resulted in an increase of EUR 0.3 million (the prior-year quarter was adjusted upwards by EUR 0.2 million). The Allgeier Group uses the retrograde method for the conversion, whereby the previous year's figures have been adjusted to the reporting for the first quarter of 2019 in order to ensure comparability of the figures. In addition to the effects in the income statement, the effects from the application of IFRS 16 also affect the balance sheet presentation due to the capitalization of rental and lease agreements with their values in use and the recognition of future payments as liabilities over the expected useful life.

220,Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG,Deutschland,Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG: Heidelberg achieves targets for 2018/19 - growing economic risks slow down growth ,DE0007314007,1147771,"Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG (Heidelberg) achieved its operating targets in financial year 2018/19 (April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019). Based on preliminary figures, group sales were reported at EUR 2,490 million - approximately 3 percent higher than the previous year. The company's core business developed positively, and the digital business model Subscription also grew as expected with around 30 contracts signed. At 7.2 percent, the operating profit margin based on EBITDA excluding restructuring result was within the target range. The profit after taxes climbed to EUR 21 million. Due to the economic downturn, the trade disputes between the US and China and the Brexit, Heidelberg is adopting a cautious approach as the new financial year 2019/20 gets underway. The company expects to see a stable development in its core business and growth in the digital subscription model. However, with underlying economic conditions making companies more reluctant to invest in new technologies, expectations regarding a ramp-up in digital printing will need to be more conservative than was originally planned. Postpress sales will grow less due to the antitrust authorities' decision to block the takeover of MBO. Furthermore, the decline in the retail business with consumables is likely to be larger than anticipated. While the company expects a stable overall development in group sales and profitability in financial year 2019/20 compared to 2018/19, economic conditions are delaying medium-term growth prospects. Heidelberg expects sales to rise at a slower pace than previously planned, with a significantly higher proportion of the cyclically resistant contract business than at present.

Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft gives no warranty and does not assume liability for any damages in case the future development and the projected results do not correspond with the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG (Heidelberg) achieved its operating targets in financial year 2018/19 (April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019). Based on preliminary figures, group sales were reported at EUR 2,490 million - approximately 3 percent higher than the previous year. The company's core business developed positively, and the digital business model Subscription also grew as expected with around 30 contracts signed. At 7.2 percent, the operating profit margin based on EBITDA excluding restructuring result was within the target range. The profit after taxes climbed to EUR 21 million. Due to the economic downturn, the trade disputes between the US and China and the Brexit, Heidelberg is adopting a cautious approach as the new financial year 2019/20 gets underway. The company expects to see a stable development in its core business and growth in the digital subscription model. However, with underlying economic conditions making companies more reluctant to invest in new technologies, expectations regarding a ramp-up in digital printing will need to be more conservative than was originally planned. Postpress sales will grow less due to the antitrust authorities' decision to block the takeover of MBO. Furthermore, the decline in the retail business with consumables is likely to be larger than anticipated. While the company expects a stable overall development in group sales and profitability in financial year 2019/20 compared to 2018/19, economic conditions are delaying medium-term growth prospects. Heidelberg expects sales to rise at a slower pace than previously planned, with a significantly higher proportion of the cyclically resistant contract business than at present.

513,All for One Group AG,Deutschland,All for One Group AG Recognises Tax Income of EUR 2.9 million from Previously Disputed Loss Carryforwards ,DE0005110001,1147783,"All for One Group AG Recognises Tax Income of EUR 2.9 million from Previously Disputed Loss Carryforwards Filderstadt, 07 May 2019 - In its half-year financial report, All for One Group AG, leading consulting and IT group, is reporting tax income of EUR 2.9 million. The tax income includes refunds of corporate income tax, solidarity surcharges and trade tax for the 2015 and 2016 tax years. In addition to the tax income, the financial result also includes interest income of EUR 0.3 million. Due to changes in the shareholder structure of All for One Group AG in the financial year 2011, recognition of corporate income tax and trade tax losses carried forward in a total amount of EUR 19.7 million was withdrawn (Section 8c German corporate income tax law) following a tax audit in May 2015. The company appealed against the ruling, citing pending court cases: In March 2018 the appeal was upheld in the form of revised provisional tax assessments for the tax year 2011. Up to and including 2016, the loss carryforwards were fully offset against profits through revised tax assessments. Until now, it seemed likely that reimbursement of these refunds would be demanded in light of the uncertainties surrounding the taxation issue relating to the provisional nature of the tax assessment and the pending court cases. This is why the amount was initially recognised with no impact on profit or loss (provision on the balance sheet). Having examined recent facts and circumstances, All for One Group AG has reached the conclusion that it is unlikely according to IAS 37 that the return of the refunds will be demanded. Accordingly, the transaction previously recognised with no impact on profit or loss, now has been reclassified as tax income of EUR 2.9 million and interest income of EUR 0.3 million in the consolidated income statement and only remains as a contingent liability in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The tax rate (income tax/EBT, 2017/18: 30%) of the financial year 2018/19 is likely to be significantly lower. The EBIT 2018/19 will not be affected.

599,curasan AG,Deutschland,"curasan AG: Volume of convertible bond, further finance commitment by investor, resolution proposals on reduction of the share capital and  subsequent capital increase with subscription rights, possible resignation of Board members and audit certificate ",DE000A2YPGM4,1146707,"Kleinostheim, 2 May 2019 - curasan AG (ISIN DE0005494538 / WKN 549453) (hereinafter also referred to as the ""Company"") announces that within the subscription offer for its convertible bond 2019/2024 as well as the subsequent private placement closed today, partial notes were placed with a volume of EUR 1,914,650.00. The convertible bond 2019/2024 will therefore be issued in a denomination of 191,465 partial notes at EUR 10.00 each with a term of 5 years and an annual interest rate of 5.00%. The interest payment for the 2-year period from 30 April 2019 to 29 April 2021 is due on 30 April 2021, all further interest payments will be made annually on 30 April of each year. The bonds can be converted into up to 1,823,476 shares of the Company at an initial conversion price of EUR 1.05 per share. The conversion right can be exercised from 22 May 2019 until 8 April 2024. The bond terms provide for annual block deliveries and special conversions in the event that the volume of outstanding bonds for which the conversion right has been effectively exercised reaches a nominal value of EUR 1 million. The Company also announces that due to the only partial placement of the convertible bond 2019/2024 and in order to maintain a positive going concern forecast for the Company, Donau Invest Beteiligungsges. m.b.H., located in Vienna (the ""Investor""), has committed to the Company to sign all shares not subscribed in the framework of a capital increase with subscription rights against cash contributions to be resolved by the Company's next General Meeting (the ""Cash Capital Increase"") at an issue price of EUR 1.05 per new share in a total volume of at least EUR 3,085,349.00 (the ""Finance Commitment""). The Finance Commitment is limited to September 15, 2019 and subject to the condition that curasan AG's next General Meeting resolves a share capital reduction at a ratio of 3:1. In view of the above, the Management Board and Supervisory Board intend to propose to the Annual General Meeting scheduled for June 26, 2019, i.a., a simplified share capital reduction according to §§ 229 et seq. German Stock Corporation Act to EUR 6,127,446.00 to cover losses by merging of shares at a ratio of 3:1 as well as a subsequent Cash Capital Increase with subscription rights against cash contributions by expected EUR 3,085,349.00 at least. The Investor's Finance Commitment is also based on the conditions precedent that (i) upon request, the currently sole member of the Management Board, Michael Schlenk (the ""CEO"") agrees to resign from his position prior to the expiration of his term of office currently limited until September 30, 2019, provided a controlled transfer to a successor has taken place or is ensured, (ii) the CEO waives all stock options granted by the Company as well as his claims for bonus payments against the Company in the amount of about EUR 47,000,00 and, (iii) upon request by the Investor, at least one of the acting members of the Supervisory Board, Dr. Detlef Wilke or Dr. Tomas Kahn, agrees to resign from the Supervisory Board mandate. The Finance Commitment becomes ineffective if insolvency proceedings are opened against the assets of the company despite the Finance Commitment. From today's perspective, the Management Board of the Company assumes that all conditions precedent for the effectiveness of the Finance Commitment will be met. Against this background, the Management Board of the Company continues to assume that the auditor will issue his respective audit opinions on the Company's financial statements and the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 within the next few days, taking into account the circumstances described above, which may also result in an indication or restriction in his audit opinion with regard to the further capital measures still required in the further course of the year. The financial statements are still expected to be published by May 13, 2019 at the latest.
